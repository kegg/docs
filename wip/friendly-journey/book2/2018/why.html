<h1>Why - Kyle Eggleston - May 24, 2018</h1>
<p>I have but one question.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>That's the question I wish to pose today. Why does anything matter in this life? Why do people allow certain things to upset them and other things not to?</p>
<p>You can see that this line of questions can go on for a bit. Even longer if you so choose them to. Talk about a concept that just begs to be answered. For ages people have wondered this question. It sometimes is combined with other questions. But Why? Has got to be at the top of the list.</p>
<p>We all know Why's brothers and sisters. The five w's and an h right?</p>
<blockquote>Who</blockquote>
<blockquote>What</blockquote>
<blockquote>When</blockquote>
<blockquote>Where</blockquote>
<blockquote>Why</blockquote>
<blockquote>How</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that covers them. From all of these you can come up with a story to tell. It covers all of your bases, but I do believe that why is the most important one. It intrigues me.</p>
<p>For example. A person does x, y, and z. But <i>why</i> did they do those things? Was there a purpose behind them doing them? You're able to gather information that way. You can grasp an understanding of what's going on in a person's mind for doing what they've done.</p>
<p>I just find it fascinating.</p>
<p>Doesn't mean my thoughts are right in any sense of the word, but it's good enough for me.</p>
<p>So the next time you want to try something new, ask <i>why</i>? See where it gets you.</p>
