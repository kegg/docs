  Today is another day. Some would have you think it was something different. 
Maybe so. Maybe not. Who's exactly to know or understand what's going on in a 
life where everything comes and goes at will.
  There are so many choices in people's lives today. Almost too many choices to 
count. But, today has meaning. Today is another day upon which you can build and 
continue to grow. Don't panic. Don't worry about tomorrow. Worry about today 
first. Then, when you get the hang of it, you can worry about tomrrow. But until 
you know where you are headed today? You shouldn't worry about the next day. or 
the day after that.
  To do so would lead to anxiety. Being anxious about the wrong things can cause 
issues and grief. This is my personal opinion, so do not take it as medical 
advice.
  Go forth and enjoy your day. Today is indeed a brand new experience.
