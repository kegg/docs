  Take a good look around you, life has issues. Life has so many issues it's 
ridiculous. So many problems with this life. Poeple like to pretend it doesn't 
happen. If you don't think about something it goes away right? Yeah... that 
would be nice, but that's not how things work out in life. Not at all.
  You would think people could understand why such thinking wouldn't work out. 
People just cannot dismiss possible thoughts because they don't want to think 
about them. All is not well. They cannot allow these thoughts to simply go by 
the wayside as it were.
  So, what can be done about it?
  People need to step up. They need to accept the possibility that life isn't 
perfect. No matter how much they ignore the issues, they must accept that there 
are things out there which are messed up and need to be addressed.
  Is that too much to ask? I don't know.
  In an ideal world? There wouldn't be any issues. This is true. Life would be 
perfect. People would be kind to each other. It would be amazing.
  But we don't live in an ideal world. That's not how any of this works out. We 
live in the now. We live in what's been handed to us. There's nothing else to be 
had from it.
  Life is what it is. Life is crazy.
  Do what you can, be aware of what's going on around you. Don't just sit there 
thinking everything will get better. You have to make it better. you have to 
cause change. Change is a must. Make a change, make everything work out for the 
better. You can do it.
