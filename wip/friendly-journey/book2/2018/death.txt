1. Not every morning begins like this. Fire reigned down from the sky. Such an 
unsuspecting sky it had been that dreadful morning.

2. I still remember the chaos of people running for cover. They were attempting 
to outrun whatever was coming for them.

3. The attack came without provocation. I call it an attack for I know not what 
else to call it. The experience destroyed many of our homes. Lives which once 
had been joyous and happy were now in utter ruins of chaos.

4. It was a sad time for all.

5. As the destruction hit, I had a sudden desire to know of the state and 
wellfare of my immortal soul. Such an odd placde to experience such a thought 
but my mind was caught up in such a struggle.

6. Watching those being destroyed all around me, I did what was best known for 
my position. Finding a nearby pile of rubble, I hid behind a large rock.

7. No sooner than I dod so, the Earth stopped quaking for the space of what felt 
like an hour. I remained hidden, not wanting to give away my position.

8. Peeking out from behind the large rock, I beheld a man. His robes were that 
of whiteness I had never beheld before. I sat in awe at the sight.

9. No longer scared or afraid, I came out from behind the rock.

10. As I saw the man, I knew him as if he had been my own brother.

11. A bright light shown around his person. It was brighter than the noon day 
sun.

12. Dropping to my knees, I bowed my head out of respect or reverence for him.

13. Walking towards me, he smiled.

14. He must have known the fear I was feeling for he called me by my name and 
bid me to rise.

15. Looking up into his smiling face, I accepted his hand and did as he 
commanded.

16. I felt the nail prints in his hand as I held it. He continued to smile.

17. I felt the loving embrace of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

18. As we lifted into the air, I knew I was to be safe in the presence of my 
Lord and my God.

19. Oh what a sight it was to behold.

20. The Savior's love did fill my soul with hope.
