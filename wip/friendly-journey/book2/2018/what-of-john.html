<h1>But What of John - Kyle Eggleston - May 24, 2018</h1>
<p>On the subject of religion, it has been said that people will go to and fro and not hear the word of God. That was during a time when the truth church of Christ was not on the earth. Many pastors and preachers came to apease those who were looking for the good word of God. Yet, as Amos stated:</p>
<blockquote>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:1</blockquote>
<p>That's exactly what happened. WIth the killing of the apostles and prophets, the true church of Jesus Christ could not be found on the earth. It was gone. People were running trying to find something that sounded like the words of Christ. Some believed they actually found it. Others wished they had found it.</p>
<p>I wonder, at times, what about the apostle that wouldn't taste of death? What happened to him? You do remember him right? Here, let me jog your memory.</p>
<blockquote>Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast a supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</blockquote>
<blockquote>Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that the disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</blockquote>
<blockquote>This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.2</blockquote>
<p>That's the apostle John.</p>
<p>If indeed John did not taste death and is still walking the Earth, he did not lose the holy priesthood which was bestowed upon him. He is an apostle of Jesus Christ, thus he still has the power that was originally given him. So was the church of Christ ever really taken from the earth?</p>
<p>We are told it was. We are told that's why a restoration was needed. We are told to have faith and believe in such things.</p>
<p>Just an interesting thought.</p>
