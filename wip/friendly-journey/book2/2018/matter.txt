  So you come into this world thinking that life actually matters at some point. 
There are so many possibilities which come and go. Some make sense. Others do 
not. Either way? Here we are. You cannot move forward you cannot move backwards. 
You are stuck. Stuck in time? Maybe. Stuck in a mess? Possibly.
  Why bother with thoughts about life? Is there a reason to care and worry about 
all the things which come across you about your day? I submit unto you, the 
thought that no it doesn't. None of it matters. You can enjoy your day, do what 
you're supposed to do. At the end of the day none of it matters so who cares.
  Do what you feel like doing. Go out and be with friends if you'd like.
  Obviously you have to keep some kind of thought process about what 
responsibilities you have. I mean none of it matters, but you have to actually 
keep up appearances as it were.
  There are those in authority who enjoy consequences. If you don't play by 
their rules? You get punished. So keep your nose clean. I mean that's not a 
difficult concept to handle right?
  Maybe it is.
  Either way, move forward and see all there is out there. If you want or need 
to feel like you accomplished something? By all means. Go out and accomplish 
something. Don't let someone keep you down from that sense of worth. If you 
don't actually need it? Toss it aside. Don't worry about it. Life will come and 
go. It doesn't have to be tossed aside completely, but it will come and go. 
that's the key. Nothing is forever.
