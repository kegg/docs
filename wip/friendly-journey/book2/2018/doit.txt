  There are days in your life where you just have to get up and do it. Whatever 
it is, you have to put forth some kind of effort. It's not known beforehand what 
effort will be required. Sometimes that knowledge is there. But not always.
  Either way, you have to go forth and do it. Whatever the task at hand. If 
you've been entrusted in some kind of task, or plan of action. You have the 
ability to go forward with all your might and push until you cannot give another 
ounce of effort.
  That's when you realize who you are and what you can become. That's the time 
when doing something, anything, will be required.
  You have the ability within yourself to do whatever it takes necessary to 
accomplish the goal.
