What Is This Life? - Kyle Eggleston - May 21, 2018
Oh what is this life to me?
I am but free, a person of circumstance
nothing is meant to be understood
this I have found out by truth
the end is another story
for it is not an end
which I would have to repeat

Had I the ability
to question or ask
any and all the things
of this life, what would I ask?
It is a hard thing to realize
when life is but young
to be able to understand such a thing

Here I sit day in and day out
waiting for something
anything to come about
oh what a coincidence
of time honored fame
but yet here I wander
through life's dreary claim
