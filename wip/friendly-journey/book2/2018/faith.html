<h1>Faith aka Does God Exist - Kyle Eggleston - May 27, 2018</h1>
<p>Such an odd life this is. I mean honestly. Who signs up for such things? I'm not even sure I did! Well that's neither here nor there. That's okay though. Life comes and goes. It doesn't expect you to understand or grasp all that's going on. It's life!</p>
<p>What do we know?</p>
<p>There are many things in life that are meant to make sense. But they don't. So where does that leave us? We are expected to live off of faith. Expecting that alone to carry us through this life. Well let me tell you. Faith alone will not do. You have to actually do something about it. That's where this life leads you. Either you understand and grasp everything that happens? Or you don't. It's simple is it not? One would think it is.</p>
<p>Well, let's talk about that for a moment. What exactly is faith?</p>
<p>We're told from the bible that Faith is a substance of hope, an evidence of things not seen. You get the gist. That might not be a direct quote, but well it will do for now.</p>
<p>So we are to have faith. Why is that? Who said that faith is the key to it all? A man in the sky? If so? We are to have faith that He exists. Does He exist though? Honestly. Think about that for a moment. Does God exist?</p>
<p>That's for each individual to try and understand.</p>
<p>Teachings say that a God does exist. He talks to people, his prophets on this earth. It's an interesting idea for sure. But, who's to say that's how it works? Who knows when the bible was written. Honestly. We don't have an exact timeline when they were written do we? What about all of those things the priests removed from the bible? What about those? Who gave them the right to remove things from the bible and to decide what goes in the bible?</p>
<p>Kind of an odd thought if you think about it. God allows men to change His words? I don't think that's how it works...honestly. That's not how it's supposed to work! But that's just my own thought on the idea. There's nothing more which can be explained from any of it now is there.</p>
<p>And that's where we are.</p>
<p>Life is confusing. Life is what it is. What are we to do regarding life? Who really knows. I sure don't. I just live here trying to figure out whatever is going on with my own life. I'm lost as anyone else.</p>
