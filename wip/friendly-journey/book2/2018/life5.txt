Some say this life is peaceful. Some say this life is amazing and
wonderful. Well that's not always the case. Life can be scary at times. Life
can be greatfully downright dreadful. It's not a happy thing for everyone
involved. Why is that? There's not much of a reason for it. Whatever the
case, we live and go through opportunities in this life and then we die.
It's rather quite simple.

What more to life is there? Who's to say anything about what this life is
all about? People have made guesses about what this life contains, but are
they really ever correct about any of it? Who's right, who's wrong? Such an
annoying thought about life to be had. I'm sure I'm not the only person to
think such thoughts. Yet there's nothing to be done about it. Life continues
to swim along and you can't turn it around.

Life is a river, you have to either jump in the current and allow you to be
swept away, or you fight it. Fighting the current isn't a good option. That
much alone can cause you to drown.

So here we are.
