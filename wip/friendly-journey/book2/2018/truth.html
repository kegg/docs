<h1>What Is Truth - Kyle Eggleston - Tue May 22, 2018</h1>
<p>To say with a surety that you know something is true cannot fully be believed unless you have a witness. THere are witnesses throughout this country on a day to day basis in court rooms. People's actions are taken into account. People are wondered about if they are telling the truth. If they know what they are saying to be the truth. Oh how these people get away with such things! What is truth. Allow it to sit here before all and everyone and tell me what you believe is trut. Provide proof of it's truthfulness, not just faith. Faith will die with you unto the grave. Do not allow yourself to be caught up in such things as faith. Facts. Cold. Hard. Facts. Are these not that which should matter most? Either it happened or it didn't. Either certain things in this generation occurred or they did not. You have to be able to judge the facts based on if they are true or not. If they be not true, then the facts will speak for themselves. If they are true? The facts will also speak for themselves. There's no going back once you know of a surety that something is false. If it is false go ahead and cast it aside, there is no reason for it to be taken as truth.</p>
<p>To be led astray by falsehoods cannot stand. A person either knows better or they will allow themselves to be betrayed the rest of their days. How do you stand up to truth? Is there truth in anything and everything upon which you dedicate yourself and your time? Where is that truth now? If you cannot answer that question did you ever have the truth to begin with? I dare say you didn't.</p>
<p>It's not an easy thing to discover you have been lied to all of these years. Something will eventually give when that happens. Hopefully it's not your sanity. That's the last thing I would want to happen to anyone. A sane mind is quite a resilliant thing to hold onto.</p>
<p>If the truth leads you insane though? How important was that truth for you to hold onto?</p>
<p>An interesting question if I do say. I suppose questions are all there are these days. If it can past a truth test, that is, if both sides of the equation can equal true; the scales are in balance and it is truth. However, if it cannot pass the test and one side weighs heavier than the other, you can know it is not true and can discard it.</p>
<p>There is no point in holding onto anything that isn't true. The truth will set you free. Is that not what scripture says? Fine then. If it is true, hold onto it. If it is not, do not waste your time with it any further. For that is all it would end up being, a waste of your time.</p>
