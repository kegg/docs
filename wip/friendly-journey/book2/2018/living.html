<h1>Living - Kyle Eggleston - Wed May 23, 2018</h1>

<p>What is life if it is living? What is it if nothing else matters?
Why not see that which is out and about if this life is meant to be
something different. Oh such a life which doesn't seem to matter. It
is a life which continues onward, forward, boldly into the future.</p>

<p>To say we are but humans having an experience in the world, that
wouldn't be enough. This life manages to be something unique to us.
Something quite different. Each person has their own ability, their
own reasoning, it is not an easy idea to process.</p>

<p>With each person having their way over life, what is it to them if
they are to understand that which is to be understood or grasped? To
every person who wishes to live and understand everything that goes
on in a life, they must have the ability to try.</p>

<p>That's where the beginning actually starts. In order to see what is
to happen in life, you have to at first try. After trying and seeing
what happens because of trying, you are able to see all that has
happened. If you do not try, you will never know the outcome of
anything that is meant to take place.</p>

<p>But what takes place when it is mean to? I've no idea. I wish I had
the ability to understand and grasp that. To be able to take a step
back and simply breathe. Breathing would be a wonderful experience,
something upon which you can grow.</p>

<p>At first you are conditioned, then you attempt to learn and grow
above all that which you are able to. There must needs be an
interesting thought process upon which you are able to do.</p>
