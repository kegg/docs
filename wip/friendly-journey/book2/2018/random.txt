What Is life

  Nothing good ever goes noticed. Everything evil never goes unnoticed. That 
is how life ends up working. That is what makes life go in circles and work 
wonders. If you can call it wonders. Perhaps it's simply a pipe dream. Either 
way, this life is here and so are we.
  To think for a moment you are able to decide everything for yourself 
without the help of another? Well while possible, it isn't the most effective 
use of your time. Having others around you, the village as it were, helps out 
immensely. Some might not have the ability to grasp or understand that now, but 
in time they can grow to accept it as truth.

What Is Truth

  People come to an understanding of the truth in different ways. Some can 
take what is known to them and by logic, determine the best outcome they should 
walk. It's not that difficult really. If you think about it? It's not difficult 
at all.
  There are times when telling the truth about something can land you in hot 
water. No one wants to be in that position now do they. Some might. Most don't. 
There are so many things a person can do to find themselves in that position. 
Simply going against the grain as it were could be reason enough.
  People don't like when others go against the grain. It's not natural, it goes 
against everything they believed in. That's where people find trouble. Someone 
presses back and the others don't understand why they would do such a thing. 
Even with documentation backing them up, people get upset over it all. It 
doesn't quite make sense? But well when it comes to certain topics, people don't 
want others to have a voice.
  What they say is gospel and you are to live by it no questions asked. Don't 
even bother questioning them. If you question them or their beliefs, you are 
labled as someone they don't want to have around. You become labled as someone 
who will go out and destroy the faith of others.
