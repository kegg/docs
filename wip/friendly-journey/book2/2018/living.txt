  What is living if it is not understood or embraced? There are times when we 
just don't know or understand what's going on. Supposedly that's okay for some. 
There should be answers to questions people have. Not everyone has an answer for 
all the questions that occur. Eventually the truth will be found. Either way, 
this life will come about and things will make sense someday, I hope.
  If the truth cannot be found, then the thought process is wrong. The truth is 
not to be found about that specific idea and it can be set aside. However if the 
truth can be found, it will be found and people should stand behind it. For what 
is more important than finding the truth?
  How shall we live with such knoledge? If we have the truth should we not fear 
about whatever comes our way? One would hope so. It comes and goes at times. The 
truth will be found someday. Eventually.
