1. Before we were created spiritually we were intelligences. That is long before 
the foundation of the world. Creation did not occur out of nothing, that is not 
God's way.

2. Intelligences were organized into spirits. Some are of a higher intelligence 
than others. This makes it possible for there to be spirit children who can 
become like God someday. That is our eventual goal to live with our Heavnely 
Father again as perfect resurrected individuals.

3. It is by death we leave this world. At the separation of our spirits from our 
bodies, our body becomes an empty shell. It has served its purpose as a home for 
our spirits.

4. Death is not our final resting place. It is but a doorway to the next steps 
of life.

5. The spirit is eternal in nature. It cannot die. The spirit makes up one half 
of a man's soul. The other half being the body. At death, the spirit and body 
separate. The spirit no longer is constrained by the physical limitations of the 
body. However the same appetites, wants, and desires continue to be with the 
spirit as it enters the Spirit World.

6. Scriptures teach, at death the spirit goes back to that God who gave it life. 
Depending on how you kept your second estate, you will end up in Spirit Prison 
or Spirit Paradise.

7. Those in prison have an opportunity to hear and accept the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ.

8. This is all part of God's plan for us.
