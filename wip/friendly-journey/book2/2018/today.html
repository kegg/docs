<h1>Today Is A New Day - Kyle Eggleston - May 24, 2018</h1>
<p>Life comes at you from so many directions. It can cause havoc upon you if you're not looking for it. Being prepared for the mess of changes that might come along your way is the key to life. Such an amusing thought now isn't it. Living and being hopeful yet watchful for the future can be of great asset to you. I'm no life coach, but I do believe those are good things.</p>
<p>There are so many good things in this life to beware of. So many opportunities to look forward to. Living a life that's full of joy and freedom are possibly some of the best things you can wish for. Granted, life doesn't always go as planned but you have the ability to help direct how you feel about things, and where your life is headed. We aren't just drifing slowly by on a raft in a rush of a current. You have the ability to direct the course of the boat from which you pilot.</p>
<p>You are the captain of your own vessel as it were. You are the one in control. Yes there are those who can help you. Be it friends and family, or a higher power if you wish to believe. But at the end of the day? It's up to you to deicde where you will go, how much energy and effort you are willing to put into it. Where you decide to focus that energy etc. It's all up to you.</p>
<p>No one can force you to become what you do not wish to become. They don't have that power over you. For those who would believe otherwise? They can go on their way and be dismissed from your life. You don't need them around you creating a hostile or harmful environment.</p>
<p>Life gets better.</p>
<p>Life is good.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is a bright new day which you are able to grab hold of and take it as long as you need to. There's no stopping you. You are the one in control of your life. That is truth.</p>
