<h1>It Is But A Thing - Kyle Eggleston - May 21, 2018</h1>
<p>It is but a thing, this weary dreadful place. For nothing that matters will come out of my face. This life will have you stopping and thinking all day, but only you'll miss it if you stop to feel God's ray. To be honest is virtuous, indeed that is to be saught. But do not think for an instant, you are here to stir the pot. Don't understand or grasp that which you cannot or will not wish. Upon your own enemy even, for that would be amiss.</p>
<p>To say you are but a simple man that's a start. Don't worry about anything until you begin to fall apart. That's not to say you shouldn't worry or take precautions if you so dare. I dare you to do so with a little bit of flare. Be therefore always thinking, and thinking you shall. But don't be thinking you're better than the higher ups for you'll sure go to hell.</p>
<p>Well that got things started now didn't it? That's not a question, I don't care about your answers. I am here but for one reason and one reason only. To see what makes you tick. There are things in this life that make people tick. That ticking is a bit more complex and different as time goes on. To understand whatever is meant to be? You have to be able to take a step back and realize you are nothing. The quicker you realize this, the faster you are able to move on with life and see what's out there.</p>
<p>If that's a pun? I'm not quite sure what kind of pun that is? I mean it could be related to <i>Star Trek</i>, but I'm not certain. Whatever the case, we are here. We are now. Is that not a good enough idea or thought regarding any of this? One would hope so.</p>
<p>Where am I going with this? Oh where indeed. You see, I'm more of a writer. I write. I try new things. I try and see what's out there. If there's anything at all of course. Nothing really makes sense in that regard. That's okay of course. There doesn't have to be anything that fully makes sense. I just know what makes sense to me in this life. That's a whole lot of nothing if you were to ask me. I know you didn't, but well there's nothing to be said about it. I am here, you are there, life is what it is. Life. That's how everything tends to come and go at times.</p>
<p>Being a life, we are all destined for one thing. I call it a destiny, but that might not be the right word for it. Who's to know. It could be a destiny. It might be something completely different. Either way, it is a thing. A timeline of events if you will. We come to this earth, live hopefully a good life, and then we die.</p>
<p>What's beyond death? I'm not sure. There are teachings out there of what's beyond this life. But well, I don't assume to know or pretend to know either. I won't even attempt that because if I were to do so and I am wrong? That would be quite embarrassing now wouldn't it be. Yes, I would dare think so. I shall leave that to the experts. Wherever they may be at the present time. Whatever the case, this life is a life that we all have to experience. Some experience life good, while others experience life in a more unpleasant manner.</p>
<p>I'd rather not go into that further. The ends will justify the means and all of that eventually. Wisdom shared and gained will be found with or without an end goal. If your end goal is to be the best person you are to be? Who's stopping you from doing that? Only yourself. There's nothing wrong with that. If you want to just get by this life without doing anything? That's possible too. However I have a feeling most people would rather be doing something productive with their lives.</p>
<p>But that's just a thought for another day. Where does this leave any of us? I'm not sure. I'd like to know, but well that would be for me to tell you of things that I do not know of and I fear that would be quite a distraction. So we won't even bother with any of that okay? Okay!</p>
<p>Whatever life brings you</p>
<p>however it wants to destroy you</p>
<p>don't let it do that</p>
<p>there is so much to live for</p>
<p>so much to gain</p>
<p>if only you'll do all</p>
<p>you can and not be</p>
<p>caught in the rain</p>
