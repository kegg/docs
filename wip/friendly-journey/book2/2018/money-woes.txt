  Money is a necessary evil in this day and age. It is needed to get by,
needed to deal in day to day life. Then there is your credit score and
history. In order to have things, commit transactions and the like, you have
to have a decent credit score. Without it, you cannot own a house, a car,
anything of the like. Once your credit score tanks, you have a difficult
time building it back up. It's possible, but a very tricky climb. Think of
it like trying to scale a sheer rock face or cliff. POssible but hard to do.
  There's nothing which can be done about any of it. Either you play by
their rules or you don't get to play at all. As they say, such is life.
