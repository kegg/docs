<h1>There Are Things That Annoy - Kyle Eggleston - May 24, 2018</h1>
<p>There are things that annoy in this life. Things which, let's be honest, shouldn't be annoying yet they are annoying. I hate annoying things. They are downright rude to be bothering me like this. People should know not to bother other people, it's that simple. But it happens, people continue to bother other people and it tends to get on your nerves. They talk to you when you last want to be bothered. You might be in the middle of something, it could be something important, and that's when the annoying person starts talking.</p>
<p>It is really stupid and annoying. I didn't ask to be bothered like this. I was content and dealing with my own life. So why must these people be interrupting my life at this moment in time?</p>
<p>Am I being rude myself by wondering these things? I don't know. Whatever the case, this life can be downright annoying to begin with all by itself. It doesn't need other people to help it along the way.</p>
<p>So, stop bothering me with your stories that I constantly hear over and over again. There's no need for such thoughts to be told more than once. I can recall and remember that which was said to me..seriously try me next time.</p>
