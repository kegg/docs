<h1>Something Awful Comes Along - Kyle Eggleston - Wed May 23, 2018</h1>
<p>There are days where you don't understand or grasp that which is happening. That happens. That's life. Life comes along and it occurs a bit before you fully grasp and understand what's going on. It happens. Did I mention that's life?</p>
<p>Well, if you don't fully grasp what is going on in life, you have to start thinking. Beliving in that which is meant to happen. Is that a wrong way of thinking? I'm not sure. To be able to think and understand and grasp, you'll have to take a step forward and <i>try</i>. That's right. You have to try in order to actually have a true attempt at anything.</p>
<p>If you don't try? That's where the consequences come. Not bad consequences mind you. They aren't always bad, they can be at times...but they aren't necessiarly bad. It so happens that bad things happen to good people, good things happen to good people, bad things happen to bad people, and good things happen to bad people. I don't think there's an actual force in the universe that forces bad things to occur on someone. Is that wrong in my thinking? I doubt it. But that is my own opinion, and that's okay.</p>
<p>The thing to keep in mind is that you aren't alone. I mean, sometimes it's your thoughts that keep you occupied. Your thoughts are able to keep you sane. Or they might not. That also happens from time to time ya know? Yeah something like that. Either way? It's life.</p>
<p>Life comes and goes when you least expect it. Isn't that the normal response to everything? Something comes along and everything else is lost? Yeah something like that. Whatever the case, life just continues to move forward. It won't wait for you. It's life. It comes and goes as it pleases.</p>
