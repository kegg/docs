	Somedays are better than others, that is no lie. Anxiety can have a
crippling effect on a person. It is more than annoying though, living with
such a disease can cause a person to shut down from time to time. They don't
want to deal with the outside world. That is too much for them to handle at
any given moment. Anixety can and will cause issues to a person. Living with
anxiety is painful at best.
	To survive day in and day out, you have to convince yourself that
what you are feeling is real, but sometimes it is also unrealisitc. Telling
someone to just ignore the feeling or thought? Yeah, that doesn't work at
all. Anxiety is ugly that way. It can and will try to destroy your sanity.
	There are people out there who don't believe anxiety is a thing.
That it is fake or made up. This is not the case. Anxiety is real. It begins
with a chemical imbalance in the brain and works its way from there. There
is notihng funny about it for it is no laughing matter.
	It's not always easy to hide your anxiety, but it can be learned so
people you are close with do not detect it happening. It takes a lot of will
power, strength, mental ability to do so. Sometimes you have to allow it to
happen, but there are also times when you have to push through no matter
what. It can be confusing.
	Either way? It's life.
