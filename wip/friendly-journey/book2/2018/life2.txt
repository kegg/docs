  Life didn't make sense ever. I mean why would it? You would think it could be 
cause of concern for actually being understood. Life could make sense if it 
wanted to, couldn't it? I would assume so. Maybe it just wasn't meant to. I 
don't know. Let's table that for now.
  So, what is all of this about? Who's to know. Someone out there has got to 
know when life will end, how everything will go down. Life has the ability to 
mess with you. You expect it all to work out, it doesn't. It would be nice if 
everything worked out the way you expect it to. But well, what are you going to 
do about it? Nothing. You can do nothing.
  You don't pass go. You don't get to celebrate anything in life. It all comes 
crashing down on you! It's a shame if you ask me. I mean, you're expecting a, b, 
and c... instead you get x, y, and z. Talk about quite a let down.
  Either way? Life will destroy itself. It isn't asking you if you want it to 
destroy it, oh no. Life would be too easy to do that. It would come and go long 
before you ever wanted or needed it to.
  Life will come and it will take over everything. It's more than just life 
though. Oh yes. It's much more complex. Something unique...or odd. Strange as it 
were.
  It's life.
