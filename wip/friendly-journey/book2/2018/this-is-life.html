<h1>This Is Life - Kyle Eggleston - May 21, 2018</h1>
<p>This is a life which comes to many. Some are able to withstand the sands of time. Others are unable to deal with any of it and fade away. It's not an easy process to grasp at times. Whatever happens in this life happens. Sometimes there isn't a reason for any of it. I suppose life can be considered cruel. That's not a pleasant thought at times. Why should it be a pleasant thought? It shouldn't be. Ah, that doesn't quite make sense. Allow me to attempt to try and explain myself. Bear with me.</p>
<p>Life comes and goes no matter what happens. You can't get through this life without trying to see what happens to it. You have the ability and right to attempt to figure everything out. It's not an easy task. It will never be an easy task. Life continues to move on, no matter what you wish it to do. So, don't worry about it. Easier said than done? Perhaps.</p>
<p>We're told to be grateful for that which we have been given, to not want for more. How is that meant to be exactly? If only there was a way to see how this life would end. I mean aside from death. Death happens, that's what will always happen and that's fine. It's meant to happen. Without death, this life wouldn't progress.</p>
<p>Oh to progress. What does that mean? What exactly does it mean to progress?</p>
<p>The dictionary states:</p>
<blockquote>The process of developing or moving gradually towards a more advanced state.</blockquote>
<p>That's a good definition right? So in order to progress a person advances in life. This life is meant to be a step upon step kind of thinking. Always a step, another step along the way. Another stone in the river of life that you jump to. Always jumping to another rock to avoid falling in the water.</p>
<p>At times we do fall in the water. It happens. It's life. That's okay. You're able to get out of the water. There's never a point in time when you won't be able to get out of the water. Then you can jump from stone to stone again.</p>
