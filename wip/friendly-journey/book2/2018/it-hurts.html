<h1>It Hurts - Kyle Eggleston - May 23, 2018</h1>
<p>Such a life comes and goes, there's nothing inbetween. It comes at you and it hurts you. Not everyone has a full understanding of what hurts you. Because it's you, and you alone. However, they can know and understand and grasp what hurts them. Each person can understand and know what hurts them, there's nothing wrong with that at all.</p>
<p>Every person who has an understanding of hurt, also has an understanding of pain, grief, relief from such things. Either way, it can and will eventually go away. The hurt won't last forever. At least that's what they say. That doesn't mean that's the truth exactly, but well who am I to argue or judge about it? I'm not one to actually argue about anything. It is but a life, and is that not all which matters the most? That life will come and go and evrerything will eventually be taken care of? Something like that. Yeah, let's go with that thought. I like that thought.</p>
<p>However, not everyone understands and grasps <i>when</i> that pain will go away. It's not up for you to decide specifcally when that pain will end up going away. You can try, however, all you want to have it go away. Sometimes it will just have to go away on its own. You have no control over it. I suppose that's where an element of faith needs to come in. You either understand and grasp what will happen, or you don't.</p>
<p>Faith is an interesting concept for people. There are times when faith will do you good. There are also times when faith won't do you a lick of good and you are stuck with whatever hand life has dealt you. Sure, you can claim faith will get you through such a crisis, but I don't think that's always the case. Sometimes you have to know what's best for you and just deal with it. Yes it hurts. But again, hurting is part of the whole process of this life. Either you hurt and move on, or you end up with the pain that is there and you don't knkow what to do about it after that. Either way? It's up to you. What do you believe in?</p>
<p>Is there anything to believe in these days? I would hope there is. The Bible is full of beliefs and things to calm the troubled mind. But if you don't accept such things into your mind and heart? Where will you end up? Such an interesting question that one is. Such an interesting question indeed.</p>
<p>I think I'll leave that question for you to answer.</p>
<p>Where will <i>you</i> end up?</p>
