  Suppose for a moment that what I've said about life not mattering is false. 
Suppose for a single fleeting moment that life actually did matter to the rest 
of us. That because the author of such a life didn't matter, doesn't meant that 
it can't matter. Oh what an interesting thought process we have now don't we. 
Life matters. Oh how life matters.
  We come here for a purpose. So the teachers of faith seem to want us to 
believe. We are here for a wise purpose. That purpose is known to God from the 
beginning. It comes down to us in the form of His words. God wants us to be 
happy and to experience joy while in this life.
  So the author is God. He can see what our lives might become, but He doesn't 
control exactly how they will come about. It's quite simple if you think about 
it. God has to obey the rules of the cosmos just like everyone else does.
  If he didn't obey the rules, he would cease to be God. Would he not? I  mean 
think about that for a minute. God can't just simply decide not to disobey the 
given rules of life. He can't circumvent all that He works from...can He?
  An interesting thought to be certain. I mean yes He can do anything, He's God. 
Nothing is beyond his abilities. He can literally do anything He wants. He 
doesn't of course. That would strip away our agency, which is another rule that 
God has to live by. He doesn't have to like the choices we make while on this 
earth, but He does have to realize that it was agency that got us here to begin 
with.
