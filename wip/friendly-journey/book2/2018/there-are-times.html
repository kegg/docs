<h1>There Are Times - Kyle Eggleston - May 24, 2018</h1>
<p>Oh how there are times in the day. Times to do everything and nothing all at once. Times for you to try and figure out something for the better, or times where you want to attempt to find out why x, y, and z happened. Not all times are good. Some are bad times. Times that make you want to run and hide from the world. It happens. It's a sad thing when that happens, but it happens.</p>
<p>Either way? The times that come and change us all are good. Change can be a good thing. Not everything has to always be the same. There are times when you want change to happen, but you do not know when or how that change will occur. That's okay too. Not everyone needs to have a full understanding or grasp of what happens in life as it's happening.</p>
<p>You are able to choose for yourself. Depending on how this life processes those times, you have some sort of control over them.</p>
