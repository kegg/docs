  Every story begins with Chapter One, the first chapter starts everything.
It happens with non stories as well. Life itself begins with a single
chapter. Naturally chapters come after that, and there can be a preface
before it. But the first chapter is the chapter to capture your reader.
  Talk about an attention grabber. That's the purpose of the chapter to
begin with right? Let me help you. The answer is yes. That's exactly what
the purpose of that first chapter is for.
  Let your life have its first chapter. Learn all you want during that time,
but remember the rest of the stroy comes along wih the rest of the chapters.
