  Somedays are more crazy than others. Let's face it. That's what happens in 
life right? I mean, here we are. Trying to do our best. Yet, what happens? Crazy 
things. Why do crazy things happen or occur? I don't know. Better yet why not 
ask a better question. Why don't more crazy things happen more often?
  Yeah, that's a good question.
  I'll let you be impressed for a bit. Just hang in there. I'm not sure you want 
to know the answer to that. There could be a good answer for it. There might be 
a bad answer for it. Either way? You'll get an answer regarding your question.
  Ready for the answer?
  I'm sure you are.
  It's just life. Life and crazy tend to go together at times. There's nothing 
more than that. It's just the way it is. I mean, you wouldn't want to try and 
explain it now would you? No, I doubt you would. So don't. Don't even bother. If 
you can't explain it? Don't. Don't try. There's no reason to attempt such a 
feat.
  There you have it.
  Life is crazy. Accept it and move on.
