  They say you can put off what you don't wish to do today onto tomorrow. That's 
not really how it's meant to work of course. But it doesn't stop people from 
doing it. Procrastination is just another day to do whatever you wish to do now. 
You can always come back to it tomorrow right?
  No.
  I submit to you that logic is false. The piper will always come looking for 
whatever he's owed. Life doesn't stop because you didn't wish it to. There are 
reasons for this. Life continues to flow. Everything continues to flow. No 
matter where you are at, life will continue to move forward, without you if 
needed.
  That's how life works. That's what life will become.
  So, don't keep tossing things for tomorrow. For tomorrow will come and then 
where will you be?
  Exactly.
