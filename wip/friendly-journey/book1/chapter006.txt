Chapter Six

If Tom had anything to do about it, whatever it was, he would immediately have 
gone to a different section of town. The priest was growing on him, it was 
becoming annoying.  

"Listen I've got to go." Tom said.

The priest looked at Tom with a frown. "Oh I see." He said. "Fine, be on your 
way. I'm sure you'll return."

Tom stood from the bench and started to walk out of the church.

"See you later." The pristed called after him.

Tom raised a hand and waved it gently. "Right old man. Right."

The priest looked around his empty church. It had been so long since he had 
someone to talk to. He was grateful that Tom had stopped by even if it was 
brief.

Tom continued his way to the other end of town. As far as he could get from the 
priest and the church the better.

Coming upon an open market, Tom's stomach growled. It had been hours since he 
last ate, he would need some form of nourishment.

Approaching the market, he saw several stands. Some held fruit, others held cuts 
of, what Tom assumed was meat. They didn't fair well out in the bright sun 
though, he didn't dare go after the meat.

Stopping at one of the fruit stands, Tom chose an apple. He offered a single 
coin in exchange. The woman seemed more than anxious to take his money and 
offered no return coinage. Either he had just been taken or that really was the 
price. He wouldn't know. Naturally he didn't ask to begin with, his poor choice 
obviously.

Nevertheless, the apple tasted good.

Tom smiled in return to the lady who batted her eye lashes. He chucked as he 
went along his way. Tom had a way with the ladies at times, it wasn't something 
he would write home about. Just that they were polite, nothing more.

He hoped it could be something more at times, but well not everyone had that 
opportunity. Some people were set to just be alone the rest of their lives. Tom 
would be content with that.
