Introduction

I began writing this piece of work under the simple title "Religion". I was 
not amused with the role religion had in people's lives at the moment and 
felt it all to be a sham of some sort or another.

After a number of months, I had abandoned the project altogether simply to 
pick it up again recently. I do not know where this storyline will lead as I 
write this introduction, but it will lead somewhere and that's all which 
matters to me now.
