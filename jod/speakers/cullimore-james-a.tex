\subsection{The Book of Mormon, April 1976}

Parley P. Pratt stated, ``The Spirit of the Lord came upon me, while I read [The Book of Mormon], and enlightened my mind, convinced my judgment, and rivetted the truth upon my understanding, so that I knew that the book was true, just as well as a man knows the daylight from the dark night." (Journal of Discourses, 5:194.)
