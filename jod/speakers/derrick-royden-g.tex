\subsection{By Their Fruits Ye Shall Know Them, 1984}

Brigham Young taught: ``All true wisdom that mankind have they have received from God, whether they know it or not. There is no ingenious mind that has ever invented anything beneficial to the human family but what he obtained it from that One Source. ...\footnote{whether he knows or believes it or not} There is only one source from whence men obtain wisdom, and that is God, the fountain of all wisdom; and though men may claim to make their discoveries by their own wisdom, by meditation and reflection, they are indebted to our Father in Heaven for all." (Journal of Discourses, 13:148.)

Brigham Young asked the question, ``When shall we cease to learn?" And then he answered his own question with the words, ``Never, never." (Journal of Discourses, 3:203.)
