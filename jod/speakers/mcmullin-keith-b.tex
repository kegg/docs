Said President Brigham Young: ``There is no spirit but what was pure and holy when it came here from the celestial world. ...\footnote{There is no spirit among the human family that was begotten in hell; none that were begotten by angels, or by any inferior being. They were not produced by any being less than our Father in heaven.} He is the Father of our spirits; and if we could know, understand, and do His will, every soul would be prepared to return back into His presence. And when they get there, they would see that they had formerly lived there for ages, that they had previously been acquainted with every nook and corner, with the palaces, walks, and gardens; and they would embrace their Father, and He would embrace them and say, `My son, my daughter, I have you again;' and the child would say, `O my Father, my Father, I am here again'" (in Journal of Discourses, 4:268).
