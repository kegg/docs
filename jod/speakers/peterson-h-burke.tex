\subsection{Our Responsibility to Care for Our Own, April 1981}

In his day, President Brigham Young said the following: ``Ever since I have been in this Church I have never suffered a relative to be maintained by the Church. But some men and women cast their children and other relatives upon the Church. If one has an aged sister who cannot maintain herself, he passes her over to the Church; or if an aged father or mother, why, `let the Church ...\footnote{or brother Brigham} take care of them and provide for them.' It is a disgrace to every man and woman that has sense enough to live, not to take care of their own relatives, their own poor, and plan for them." (Journal of Discourses, 8:145.)
