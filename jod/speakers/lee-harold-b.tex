But now the members of this church throughout the world must brace themselves for the never-ending contest between the forces of righteousness and the forces of evil. The Prophet Joseph Smith made this declaration to the Twelve, borne out of his experience, and to which many of us since that time can testify. He said:

``You will have all kinds of trials to pass through. And it is quite as necessary that you be tried as it was for Abraham and other men of God, and ... God will feel after you, and he will take hold of you and wrench your very heart strings, and if you cannot stand it you will not be fit for an inheritance in the Celestial Kingdom of God." (John Taylor, in Journal of Discourses, vol. 24, p. 197.)
