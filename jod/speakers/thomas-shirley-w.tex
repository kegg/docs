\subsection{An Opportunity for Continual Learning, October 1981}

One early Church leader asserted that ``In this world of change, where we are required to make advancement, we must have an increase of intelligence. ...\footnote{to satisfy the craving development of our own mental powers} There is no stopping place for a man [or woman] of God." (Orson Hyde, Journal of Discourses, 7:151.) In light of this need, we are grateful to a loving Father who has provided in Relief Society a program for continual learning.
