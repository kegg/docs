President Young had said when they entered the Valley: ``If they let us alone ten years we would ask no odds of them." Ten years to the day a messenger arrived with word that Johnson’s army was marching west with orders to ``settle the Mormon question."

President Young told the Saints: ``[We] have been driven from place to place; ... we have been scattered and peeled. ...\footnote{I have been in this kingdom a good while—twenty-five years and upwards, and I have been driven from place to place; my brethren have been driven, my sisters have been driven; we have been scattered and peeled, and every time without any provocation upon our part, only that we were united, obedient to the laws of the land, and striving to worship God. Mobs repeatedly gathered against this people, but they never had any power to prevail until Governors issued their orders and called out a force under the letter of the law, but breaking the spirit, to hold the “Mormons” still while infernal scamps cut their throats. I have had all that before me through the night past, and it makes me too angry to preach. Also to see that we are in a Government whose administrators are always trying to injure us, while we are constantly at the defiance of all hell to prove any just grounds for their hostility against us; and yet they are organizing their forces to come here, and protect infernal scamps who are anxious to come and kill whom they please, destroy whom they please, and finally exterminate the ``Mormons."}

``We have transgressed no law, ...\footnote{and we have no occasion to do so,} neither do we intend to; but as for any nation’s coming to destroy this people, God Almighty being my helper, they cannot come here." (Journal of Discourses, 5:226; 14:108)

\subsection{Teach Them Correct Principles, April 1990}

``I have told you many times," President Brigham Young said, ``the property which we inherit from our Heavenly Father is our time, and the power to choose in the disposition of the same. This is the real capital that is bequeathed unto us by our Heavenly Father." (In Journal of Discourses, 18:354; italics added.)
