On November 1, 1857, Elder George A. Smith delivered a memorable discourse, which included this old Chinese fable:

``A man travelling through the country came to a large city, very rich and splendid; he looked at it and said to his guide, `This must be a very righteous people, for I can only see but one little devil in this great city.'

``The guide replied, `You do not understand, sir. This city is so perfectly given up to wickedness ...\footnote{corruption, degradation, and abomination of every kind,} that it requires but one devil to keep them all in subjection.'

``Travelling on a little farther, he came to a rugged path and saw an old man trying to get up the hill side, surrounded by seven great, big, coarse-looking devils.

```Why,' says the traveller, `this must be a tremendously wicked old man! See how many devils there are around him!'

```This,' replied the guide, `is the only righteous man in the country; and there are seven of the biggest devils trying to turn him out of his path, and they all cannot do it.'" (Journal of Discourses, 5:363–64.)

After relating the fable, Elder Smith added that ``the devil has the world so perfectly at his disposal that it requires few devils to keep it in subjection" and that ``the whole legion of devils has nothing to do but look after the `Mormons' and stir up the hearts of the children of men to destroy them—to put them out of existence." (Journal of Discourses, 5:364.)
