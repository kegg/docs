\title{Quotes from The Journal of Discourses in Church Publications}
\author{Kyle Eggleston}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

The Official Church Website (lds.org) has indicated the following:

\begin{displayquote}
The Journal of Discourses is not an official publication of The Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is a compilation of sermons and other 
materials from the early years of the Church, which were transcribed and then 
published.\footnote{
https://www.lds.org/topics/journal-of-discourses?lang=eng  
}
\end{displayquote}

The church claims that not all of the talks and sermons were transcribed 
correctly and there are errors in them. So instead of trying to decide which
are good and which are incorrect, they simply tossed the whole 26 volume
of books out claiming it not to be official church doctrine.

There are times in General Conference, and one instance of the LDS Church 
Essays when the Journal of Discourses were used. Quotes from the discourses 
are presented here with the talks and articles they came from.
