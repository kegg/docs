\section{Things Change}

\begin{displayquote}
In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was of 
God.\footnote{John 1:1} 
\end{displayquote}

Jesus Christ was the \textit{word} that is spoken of.

It could be said that Jesus was God. But only in the sense that he was the 
God of the Old Testament.\cite{otStudentManual} However, that's not how the
words were originally written:

\begin{displayquote}
In the beginning was the gospel preached through the Son. And the gospel was 
the word, and the word was with the Son, and the Son was with God, and the Son 
was of God.\footnote{JST John 1:1}
\end{displayquote}

So, why the change? We're told that many plain and precious truths of the bible 
had been removed and lost,\footnote{1 Nephi 13:26-27} from the \textit{``great 
and abominable church''}.

There was a council of Carthage (397) in which it was decided the books to
be considered canon for the Bible. The books were named and no books have
been added to the Bible since.

Who was this ``great and abominable church"?

That question is still up for debate. Obviously it's the church of the devil. 
But is there a church standing today that classifys as that? I'd rather not 
go into that. We know what Bruce R. McConkie thought about it in Mormon 
Doctrine, that theory had later changed, and was removed from the book 
completely. Mormon Doctrine is no longer in Deseret Bookstore shelves. I wonder 
why that is.\footnote{[Under the heading, ``Church of the Devil," Apostle Bruce 
R. McConkie lists:] "The Roman Catholic Church specifically—singled out, set 
apart, described, and designated as being ‘most abominable above all other 
churches’ (I Ne. 13:5)" (Mormon Doctrine, 1958, 129).}

With changing times come other changes that people make. I suppose this article 
is all about change isn't it.

People change as time changes. What was right back in the 1800s or the 1600s, 
isn't right now. Hanging a witch, for example, people got that from Exodus 
22:18.\footnote{Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.} But, we learn from the 
Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, that it's not the word 
witch.\footnote{Thou shalt not suffer a \textit{murderer} to live. 
[JST Exodus 22:18]} Quite different between a witch and a murderer right?

Changes happen because men polute the words of God.\footnote{Mormon 8:36,38}

So, why would God allow these changes? We are told He allows people to have
agency, yet one would think He wouldn't allow men to pollute His holy word?
I suppose it is neither here nor there. That is fine and well.

I should point out that not all changes are evil. Not all changes come from 
Satan, the Devil, the Father of all lies. There are some changes in life that 
are actually good. Some changes that come because change was needed. You can see 
it in history. If you don't know what kind of changes I'm talking about, 
seriously go crack open a history book and see all there is to see and learn 
about.

\section{Race and the Eternal Salvation Ban}

Long ago, the LDS Church stated that the negro race weren't allowed to hold the 
Holy Priesthood of God. They weren't able to attend the temple either. This 
lasted for several years. Then change came about, and in 1978 a revelation was 
passed down that lifted this ban.

Before the change, presidents and apostles of the church had no issue stating in 
no uncertain terms that the ban was of God. It was god's doing, the Lord put the 
ban in place and it was His purpose for doing so. That it was doctrine.

After the ban, they said it was folklore. The reasons for doing so was because 
of man.

How is it one generation of prophets and apostles can call an older generation 
false on their teachings? Teachings people followed because they were following 
the prophet?

Brigham Young stated that he was afraid people would have too much faith in the 
presidency of the church and him as a prophet that they wouldn't ask God if 
something was right.\footnote{I am more afraid that this people have so much 
confidence in their leaders that they will not inquire for themselves of God 
whether they are lead by him. [Brigham Young, (12 January 1862) Journal of 
Discourses 9:150]}

Well, if you were all for a black person getting the priesthood, or questioned 
your leaders about it because you felt that was the correct course of 
action...you were facing excommunication.

So change can come, but it can also come at quite a price.

I think it is okay to ask this. If the ban wasn't of God as church leaders are 
now saying, then why did God allow it? Why would God allow such a thing to take 
place? If it was indeed ``folklore", one would think God wouldn't allow prophets 
and apostles of the church to allow people to think the negro would never 
receive the priesthood and temple ordinances.

There are so many quotes on the matter it sickens me to think about it.

But it is all cleared up by one remark by an apostle. Bruce R. McConkie:

\begin{displayquote}
Forget everything that I have said, or what President Brigham Young or 
President George Q. Cannon or whomsoever has said in days past that is contrary 
to the present revelation. We spoke with a limited understanding and without the 
light and knowledge that now has come into the world.\footnote{All Are Alike 
Unto God, Bruce R. McConkie, Aug 18, 1978}
\end{displayquote}

If change can be simply accepted based on a revelation from God then that is 
good right? Why did it take a revelation to change policy? The church claims it 
was a policy not doctrine. Even though it was taught as doctrine throughout the 
course of history.

Do the lines between doctrine and policy blur at times? Perhaps more change?

There are scriptures that reference to the people's skin being turned dark due 
to sin or not following God's will while on the Earth. Cain was the first man to 
go dark because of murder. A mark of darkness was placed upon man in the event 
that anyone would come across him.\footnote{And the Lord said unto him, 
Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. 
And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill 
him.[Genesis 4:15]}

In the Book of Mormon we learn about the Lamenites and the Nephites. The 
Lamenites had the dark skin:

\begin{displayquote}
And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set 
upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them because of their transgression 
and their rebellion against their brethren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and 
Joseph, and Sam, who were just and holy men.\footnote{Alma 3:6}
\end{displayquote}

God says that the cursing is so the wicked people wouldn't be enticing to those
who followed the commandments of God.

\begin{displayquote}
And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, 
because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against 
him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, 
and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my 
people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon 
them.\footnote{2 Nephi 5:21}
\end{displayquote}

Before 1978, there was certain things taught. One of those teachings was that 
the dark skinned people were less valiant in the pre-existence. This has been
shot down. There were no fence sitters in the pre-existence in the war in 
heaven. Either you chose Jesus or you chose Lucifer.\footnote{Apostle Joseph 
Fielding Smith, for example, wrote in 1907 that the belief was ``quite general" 
among Mormons that ``the Negro race has been cursed for taking a neutral 
position in that great contest." Yet this belief, he admitted, ``is not the 
official position of the Church, [and is] merely the opinion of men." 
Joseph Fielding Smith to Alfred M. Nelson, Jan. 31, 1907, 
Church History Library, Salt Lake City.}

Now you'll notice I called this an ``Eternal Salvation Ban" not simplay a 
``Priesthood Ban" as the church tends to simplify it. No, it's more than that.
It was a temple ban. People of color weren't able to be sealed to their loved
ones, which is one of the main points of LDS Doctrine. The idea of eternal
families.

Feels like a slap to the face of those wanting to be sealed to their spouses,
children, parents, loved ones etc. If you claim to have revelation from God and
part of that is that the whole human race has the ability to be together 
forever, why would God allow for man to withold that from his children?

Now, the church considers it a revelation. But in an interview with the apostle
LeGrand Richards, it sounds quite different.

\begin{displayquote}
WALTERS: Now when President Kimball read this little announcement or paper, 
was that the same thing that was released to the press?

RICHARDS: Yes.

WALTERS: There wasn't a special document as a ``revelation", that he had and 
wrote down?

RICHARDS: We discussed it in our meeting. What else should we say besides 
that announcement? And we decided that was sufficient; that no more 
needed to be said.\footnote{Interview with Apostle LeGrand Richards,
By Wesley P. Walters and Chris Vlachos, 16th August 1978, Church Office Building
(Recorded on Cassette)}
\end{displayquote}

There was no ``Thus saith the Lord" in the Official Declaration 2. So I question
you, dear reader, was it a revelation? I dare say it wasn't. I dare say it was
a policy change. I dare say what was once taught as doctrine and taught as it
was from God was changed by the pressures and will of man.

Speaking of Official Declaration 2, here is the text in it's entirety.

\begin{displayquote}
To Whom It May Concern:

On September 30, 1978, at the 148th Semiannual General Conference of The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the following was presented by 
President N. Eldon Tanner, First Counselor in the First Presidency of the 
Church:

In early June of this year, the First Presidency announced that a revelation 
had been received by President Spencer W. Kimball extending priesthood and 
temple blessings to all worthy male members of the Church. President Kimball 
has asked that I advise the conference that after he had received this 
revelation, which came to him after extended meditation and prayer in the 
sacred rooms of the holy temple, he presented it to his counselors, who 
accepted it and approved it. It was then presented to the Quorum of the 
Twelve Apostles, who unanimously approved it, and was subsequently presented 
to all other General Authorities, who likewise approved it unanimously.

President Kimball has asked that I now read this letter:

June 8, 1978

To all general and local priesthood officers of The Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints throughout the world:

Dear Brethren:

As we have witnessed the expansion of the work of the Lord over the earth, we 
have been grateful that people of many nations have responded to the message 
of the restored gospel, and have joined the Church in ever-increasing numbers. 
This, in turn, has inspired us with a desire to extend to every worthy member 
of the Church all of the privileges and blessings which the gospel affords.

Aware of the promises made by the prophets and presidents of the Church who have 
preceded us that at some time, in God’s eternal plan, all of our brethren who 
are worthy may receive the priesthood, and witnessing the faithfulness of those 
from whom the priesthood has been withheld, we have pleaded long and earnestly 
in behalf of these, our faithful brethren, spending many hours in the Upper Room 
of the Temple supplicating the Lord for divine guidance.

He has heard our prayers, and by revelation has confirmed that the long-promised 
day has come when every faithful, worthy man in the Church may receive the holy 
priesthood, with power to exercise its divine authority, and enjoy with his 
loved ones every blessing that flows there from, including the blessings of the 
temple. Accordingly, all worthy male members of the Church may be ordained to 
the priesthood without regard for race or color. Priesthood leaders are 
instructed to follow the policy of carefully interviewing all candidates for 
ordination to either the Aaronic or the Melchizedek Priesthood to insure that 
they meet the established standards for worthiness.

We declare with soberness that the Lord has now made known his will for the 
blessing of all his children throughout the earth who will hearken to the 
voice of his authorized servants, and prepare themselves to receive every 
blessing of the gospel.

Sincerely yours,

SPENCER W. KIMBALL

N. ELDON TANNER

MARION G. ROMNEY

The First Presidency

Recognizing Spencer W. Kimball as the prophet, seer, and revelator, and 
president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it is proposed 
that we as a constituent assembly accept this revelation as the word and 
will of the Lord. All in favor please signify by raising your right hand. 
Any opposed by the same sign.

The vote to sustain the foregoing motion was unanimous in the affirmative.

Salt Lake City, Utah, September 30, 1978.\footnote{Official Declaration 2, 
Doctrine and Covenants}

\section{As man now is, God once was}

As was taught from teachings of a certain president of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, Lorenzo Snow taught:

\begin{displayquote}
As man now is, God once was:

As God now is, man may be.\footnote{In Eliza R. Snow Smith, Biography and 
Family Record of Lorenzo Snow (1884), 46; see also ``The Grand Destiny of Man," 
Deseret Evening News, July 20, 1901, 22.}
\end{displayquote}

This appears to be another thing has has gone under some change? For according
to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saint's official news 
page,\footnote{http://mormonnewsroom.com} we don't follow that teaching anymore.

Let's pull a quote directly from a FAQ on that site:

\begin{displayquote}
\textbf{Do Latter-day Saints believe they can become ``gods"?}

Latter-day Saints believe that God wants us to become like Him. But this 
teaching is often misrepresented by those who caricature the faith. 
The Latter-day Saint belief is no different than the biblical teaching, 
which states, ``The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, 
that we are the children of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, 
and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be 
also glorified together" (Romans 8:16-17). Through following Christ's 
teachings, Latter-day Saints believe all people can become ``partakers of the 
divine nature"
(2 Peter 1:4).\footnote{https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/mormonism-101}
\end{displayquote}

If church members are not taught that we can become Gods, what was the 
revelation in Doctrine and Covenants 76 for? It teaches of the three kingdoms
of God, specifically the Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial kingdoms.

There's a scripture in that, verse 58 that states:

\begin{displayquote}
Wherefore, as it is written, they are gods, even the sons of 
God—\footnote{D\&C 76:58}
\end{displayquote}

This is describing those who belong to the Celestial Kingdom. If we are not to
become Gods, as is stated in the Mormon Newsroom article, then what is it? Which
source does one believe pertaining to their eternal salvation, given that they
``come forth in the resurrection of the just."\footnote{D\&C 76:50} 

Past prophets speaking vs current policy teaching. Which is true and which is
false? Again, why a change? Why can't the church stand boldly in what they have
taught to be the truth and continue with it? Why must changes need to be made?
