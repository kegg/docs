Web Standards
=============

by Kyle Eggleston

The internet has become rather lax in its portrayal of documents. Standards that are no longer good practice are still used and deprecated tags are alive and well. Browsers support these tags even though they shouldn't. Moving forward means keeping up to date in a world that's constantly changing. I wonder what would happen if all browsers stopped supporting the font tag. There are still sites out there that use this lovely deprecated tag. It was an attempt to put some style in the browser by defining a font. Long before CSS came around and actually helped in defining how documents should look.

Long were the browser wars in the late 90s. Everyone wanted a piece of the action. It ended up being between Microsoft IE and Firefox. Both products are alive and well. Each browser brings strengths to the job. Each browser falls short as well.

Years later more browsers have surfaced. Some are quick and snappy, others still need time to mature and get there. In time, they will get there. Will they have to keep dealing with outdated code is the question.

The latest version of HTML is version 5. Due to backwards compatibility of websites, browsers still support HTML 3.2 markup. This needs to stop. If people aren't keeping their code up to date, then their site should suffer by not being able to be viewed. Non updated code could possibly mean they aren't maintaining the website anymore. Of course it could also mean they've just been lazy and figured using old code that still worked wasn't an issue. Next years budget will cover that right?... and the next, and the next after that... and so on and so forth.

The W3C is out there taking command of the web and the standards out there. That's great! When will all of the browsers get in line and actually do something about it? You know how the quirks go. IE behaves differently than Firefox, Firefox behaves differently than Chrome etc. etc. etc. Don't even get me started on Safari.

So what can we as web developers do? Conform to standards. Don't write ugly code that would take forever to figure out! Now I understand when you're making an actual web program work, sometimes the code gets icky. I'm talking about documents that are meant to be read. Like this document for example. Read by people, screen readers, etc. Conform to standards and everyone will remain happy and calm. But one question, how do we do this?

1. Use proper titles
2. Correctly nest tags
3. Get rid of any deprecated tags, don't use them
4. Use CSS for styling your documents
5. Use tables for tabular data only
