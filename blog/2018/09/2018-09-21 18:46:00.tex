Life is what it was, a place to begin the external abilities. Once a person understands what is going on in their life, they begin to grasp a bit better anything and everything which they might encounter. It is not for a person to decide, however if they wish to understand everything that is going to happen in their life, they must grasp one simple rule.

Don't mess up.

It's that simple isn't it? One would think it would be. Don't mess things up and you'll be fine in the end. The end of what exactly? I'm not sure. But it could be beneficial to those around you to figure something out quite fast.

For those of us that do mess up? Well life continues to move forward. There's nothing you can do about that. I mean, life will do what it will always want to do. What are you going to say to such a life? Hey, I don't want you to be doing that anymore? Pretty sure that's NOT how it works. Actually I'm 100\% certain that's not how life works. So you can't keep thinking that's what will happen when this life is over. Nope, don't even begin to think that.

There has got to be a better way to figure out this life. Something more concrete. Either way? We'll deal and figure it out.
