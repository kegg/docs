# There Should Be Space
## Wed Feb 12 20:54:57 MST 2020

There should be space where nothing makes sense and
that's okay with everyone. There shoudl be a place
where absolutely nothing matters, and we don't
have a clue what's going on, but again it doesn't
matter...so we survive.

Things like that. Isn't that okay? Isn't that what
this life should be about?

Something like that.
