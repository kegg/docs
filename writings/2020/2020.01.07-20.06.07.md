  There has got to be some reason for these thoughts. Whatever thoughts come 
into my mind, I mean they have to have a reason right? Worry, regret, things I 
can't control. Everything else which simply can't be understood or 
controlled...things like that. I don't know what to do with these thoughts. 
People tell me to simply forget about them. Let them go. Who's to know how 
that's meant to work out. I don't have a clue. I wish I did. That would be nice, 
but I don't.
  I mean, if life is meant to be simple...a breeze, something we're meant to 
accomplish well into our 90s etc, if we live that long. Then aren't we suppose 
to be able to do something with it? Aren't we meant to be able to accomplish 
something and just be there for each other? No matter what happens? Life comes 
and goes, it's not meant to be out there out there, but here we are. We don't 
knkow what happens all the time. We don't know what goes on when we aren't 
listening or aren't watching. We simply don't know.
