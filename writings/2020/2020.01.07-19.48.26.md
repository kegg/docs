  Maybe life isn't actually meant to be made sense of... what if we're just here 
doing our thing and we don't exactly know why we are here or what we are doing? 
Is that possible? I don't see why not. I mean, if we are here and other people 
are someplace else...wouldn't that simply make sense that they want something 
good to happen to them as well? I would think so.
