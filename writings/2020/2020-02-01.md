# What A Morning
## Sat Feb  1 06:35:06 MST 2020

Let's talk about today shall we? This morning has been bruital. I'm reading over 
the signs of depression. I have them.... boy do I have them. I don't know what 
to do about that. It would be nice not to have to deal with any of those 
thoughts anymore. I don't want to be here. I don't want to live. There's no 
reason for me to be alive. People don't get it, they don't want to understand 
it. So, what happens next? What's the next step?
