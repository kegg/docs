# You Are In Control
## Jan 3, 2020

Today is just another day. There's nothing wrong with that. I mean if you wish 
it were a normal day then make it a normal day. If you want it to be a day where 
nothing happens, let it be a day where nothing happens. Just let it be whatever 
you wish it to be! There's no one there to tell you how your day will go. You 
decide how you want your own day to go and how you want it to be. You do. No one 
else. It's that simple.
