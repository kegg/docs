  Today doesn't feel like much of a day. I can't explain it. It just feels like 
something is bothering me and I don't know what.
  It would be nice to figure out exactly what is going on, but well when you 
can't figure things out like this? What are you meant to do. Exactly. Nothing. 
There's nothing you are able to do about any of it, you're stuck with everything 
that comes your way. I doubt it has anything to do with anything I've done or 
not done. Just that I'm confused by why I feel this way.
  So there's that I guess.
