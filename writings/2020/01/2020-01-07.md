Let's talk about today than shall we? I'd like to think it would be a nice 
moment in time if we could simply get along with everything that happens in this 
life, yet I doubt it will. It's a shame if you think about it. A real shame. But 
what are you going to do with any of it? No one knows exactly. So here we sit 
waiting for something better to come along, hoping for something to happen and 
allowing us to actually see what is real and what isn't.
