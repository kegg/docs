# Chapter One

There was a time in life where things made sense. I don't know when that time 
was exactly, just that it existed. It would be nice if there was something out 
there that actually made sense today. But nothing make sense. Here we are 
sitting and waiting for something to actually come along and have some kind of 
condition to make sense. Here we are and it just doesn't jive.

There I sat, at the edge of the tub. Thinking about how life had turned upside 
down in an instant. Could I have prevented any of it? I'm not sure. I simply 
don't know if I could have prevented it at all. I just know what life is for me 
at this present moment in time.

The tub jets seemed to quiet my mind a bit. That was helpful. It was enough to 
get my mind off the razor blade sitting on the counter. Not today. Today wasn't 
the day to attempt that part of it all. It was all part of a plan at least, a 
plan which would have to come to fruition someday. Today was not that day.
