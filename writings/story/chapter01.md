# Chapter One

There was a time in life where things made sense. I don't know when that time 
was exactly, just that it existed. It would be nice if there was something out 
there that actually made sense today. But nothing make sense. Here we are 
sitting and waiting for something to actually come along and have some kind of 
condition to make sense. Here we are and it just doesn't jive.
