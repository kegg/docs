\section{Naughty Baby Girl Part 13}

    Entering the campground, Papa looked for just the right spot. They unpacked the car.

    “Papa” baby girl said “We don’t have a tent.”

    Papa shook his head. “Nope we do not, but we have sleeping bags. Guess we’ll sleep under the stars.”

    Baby girl squealed. “Yay!”

    Papa nodded “... and fuck under the stars.”

    “Oooo.” She said. “Haven’t done that before.” Biting her lip, she thought of all the possibilities.

    Papa smiled. “Love you baby girl.”

    “Love you too Papa.”

    They found a nice big smooth rock to lay the sleeping bags on.

    Papa grabbed another bag from the car. “Tonight we’ll have marshmallows, I’ll probably burn mine, but well it’ll work.”

    Baby girl hugged Papa. It was starting to be a perfect night.
