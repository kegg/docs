\section{Naughty Baby Girl Part 10}

     Driving off, Papa and baby held hands. No one could stop them now. Kinda like Bonnie and Clyde, except they weren’t robbing banks. ‘Cause that would be weird.

    They traveled to a restaurant either Papa or baby had been to before. Sitting down, Papa looked at the menu.

    It was then she came through the door.

    “Oh hell.”

    Baby looked over, “What”?

    Papa smiled “That cop lady is here.”

    Cop lady was there, but she wasn’t dressed in her uniform. She was dressed in a black evening gown looking for trouble.

    Passing by their table, cop lady smiled. “Don’t I know you from somewhere?”

    Papa smiled. “No, I don’t think so.”

    She winked at baby. “You’re the couple I pulled over this morning.”

    “Oh yeah” Papa said. “That. Uh huh.”

    “I have business for the two of you.” She said. Reaching down, she grabbed baby’s bum. “Yes, both of you.”

    She smiled. “Come with me.”
