     The police officer kicked Papa’s feet apart.

    Papa grinned.

    “You like that?”

    Papa nodded. “Yes ma’am.”

    She flipped him around so he was facing her. “And if I were to take these cuffs off you?”

    “I’d put them on you instead.”

    She looked Papa in the eyes. Other people had been rude to her, but he actually meant what he said. Oh he’d be fun. She bit her lip.

    Just then a call came over her radio.

    “Fuck.” She said. “Looks like it’s your unlucky day. I have to go.”

    Uncuffing Papa, the cop went back to her car and drove off. “Get a fucking license! And learn to obey the speed limit.”

    Papa nodded. “Right.”

    He got in his car and looked at Baby. “Piece of cake.”

    Baby smiled back.
