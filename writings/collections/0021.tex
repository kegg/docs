    “Knock knock” The police officer tapped on the window.

    Papa rolled down the window. “Problem officer?”

    She looked back at him. “License and registration.”

    Papa nodded. “Of course.” He reached into the glove box for his registration and handed it to her.

    “License?”

    Papa shrugged. “Must have left it at home.”

    The officer sighed. “Social Security Number?”

    “Three.”

    The police officer opened the car door. “Step out of the car.”

    Papa winked at Baby. Here we go.

    Stepping out of the car, Papa smirked. He didn’t have a license. It was just a fun drive with his girl. Papa didn’t expect to be pulled over. Oops. His mistake.

    The officer forced Papa against the car. “No license, and you’re playing jokes.” She searched him. “No guns or weapons. Smuggling drugs?” She paused. “There isn’t anything in your pants that’s going to poke me is there?”

    Papa laughed. “Only if you want to honey.”

    “That’s it.” She pulled out the cuffs and handcuffed Papa. “Sit down.”

    Papa sat down on the side of the road.
