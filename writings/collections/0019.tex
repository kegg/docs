    Baby girl looked up from her coloring book and showed Papa. “See? I dis.”

    Papa smiled in return. “Beautiful artwork sweetie.” She had colored a heart, it was soothing for baby girl to color. Papa enjoyed it too.

    Stroking her hair, Papa continued to smile. “Want another one?”

    Baby smiled “Yes Papa!”

    Reaching into his pocket, Papa brought out a new set of colors. “Papa bought you this.”

    “Gimmie!” Baby girl said with excitement. Her hands went to grabby mode.

    Taking the coloring pencils in her hands, Baby girl squealed. “WEEEEEE!”

    “Oh fank you Papa! Fank you!”

    Papa continued to stroke her hair as she colored.

    Baby girl continued to color until it was nap time.

    Papa took Baby girl by the hand and they went and laid down on the bed. Baby girl put her head on Papa’s chest and listened to his heart beating.

    “Dat’s you!”

    “Yes, that’s me.”

    They snuggled. Baby girl felt comfy and secure from all the scary things in the world. She had her Papa.
