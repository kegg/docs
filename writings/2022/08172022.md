Life wasn't meant to be easy. life was simply meant to be. I don't know exactly 
how this life was meant to be, but I do know life wasn't meant to be crazy.

What if life was meant to be something different? I mean
here we are just waiting for something to come along right?
What if it doesn't come? What then?
