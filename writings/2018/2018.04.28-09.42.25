  I had a dream last night. The location of it is unimportant. But there was a 
man there who was boasting of a new prophet which he believed in. I told him it 
was false. he turned to me and said, how do you know your church is true?
  The thought came to me. If the church is true, why need I fear? If the prophet 
is a good man and holds up good works and deeds, why need I fear? For such the 
church I belong to was truer than this prophet of which he claimed to be true 
because I knew.
  I'm not sure what to think about said dream, for it is a dream... is it not? 
My mind has been weighed down for a while now about such matters. If it is just 
my mind trying to figure things out? I don't knkow what to say.
