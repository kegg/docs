  Let's not discuss that which shouldn't be discussed. Perhaps there's another 
time when this life can adequately be figured out. I mean if we don't understand 
everything that's going on right now? Who's to say that we'll ever understand 
it. So that's where I'm at.
  This life doesn't always make sense. There are so many thoughts and processes 
which come and go. You need to figure out everything that can be determined. I 
mean what else is there? Is there really anything else to be figured out at this 
point? I doubt it.
  So, where does that leave us?
  In the dark?
  I think not.
  It would leave us in a determined place. Somewhere between night and daytime 
where we can actually figure out life. Yes that life which will eventually make 
sense... maybe? Maybe. We'll have to wait and see I suppose. Yes indeed.
  Either way? We'll live. That's all there is to life. Simply live. Do what you 
can do and see what takes place.
