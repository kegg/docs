  There could be something more said about life. But well it's not really all 
there is ya know? Life tends to come and go. That's really all there is. We live 
and we die. What more do you want from it? I don't know. I really don't know. 
Who's to understand fully what's going on in this life. I mean, there are 
ideas...thoughts...other things? I don't know.
  Today wasn't too bad. Life did its thing. We all continue to live.
  Is that not enough?
