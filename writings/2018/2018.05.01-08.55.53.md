  Been writing a document of sorts. Something faith promoting for Mom and Dad 
about Christ. We'll see how it goes. I think they'd enjoy it for a Christmas 
gift, seems fitting right? Yeah something like that.
  Reminds me, I have another document somewhere. It contained a lot of talks I 
had given on my mission. I need to find that so I can finish that and possibly 
publish that in a book as well. Should prove interesting.
