  Published a book I've been working on for a few months. It won't go anywhere, 
that is for sure. For it cannot go anywhere. It must remain in my home and not 
see the light of day. Why is this? There are questions inside the book. 
Questions, doctrine, policy, critisim. Everything which I cannot publish out 
into the world. To do so would mean the end of me. So I shall keep it deep 
within and not publish it.
  My parents would flip. I would be excommunicated for such conversations and 
thoughts. Only because a corporation doesn't want their members to think for 
themselves.
  I suppose that's okay.
  I wish my parents ad never forced me into a religion. I think I would have 
been better off if that hadn't of happened. But well, who am I to judge? I am 
but a man and I also sin in my life. I'm not perfect. I am only a person to 
understand and grasp that which I can.
  I could be wrong. That thought has crossed me. But logic and feelings tell me 
otherwise. Oh what to do about this? I doubt there's anything to do. So I will 
quietly sit here and not worry about it. What is done is done. It will sit on my 
shelf and never see the light of day.
  I suppose that's how everything works these days. I'm good with that.
