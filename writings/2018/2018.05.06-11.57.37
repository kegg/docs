  Finished writing a book. Are We Not All Believers In Christ? Lastnight while I 
waited for Jane to get home. It's not much of a book, only 80ish pags or so. But 
it will do. It's not a perfect typesetting either. But after giving it some 
thought, that's okay with me. We are not perfect, it's a shadow of that I think. 
Yes that will do just fine.
  I might add to it later, make a second edition of the book. Fix the 
typesetting issues, update the notes at the end so the scriptures are actually 
pulled in instead of just references to them. We'll see what happens.
  Other than that, life is okay.
  Kiddos are sick. That's not fun. Izayiah and Bernice have been puking 
lastnight. Not good at all. Upset tummies are the worst.
  Tomorrow we go and take a look at the green binders. Oh what joy that will be. 
Let me tell you how much I hate that process. You want to know the history of 
things that happened... yet you don't. It's a mess it really is a mess.
