  Been thinking a lot as of late. Not sure what to do about anything. Life seems 
to be a constant uphill battle. A battle I no longer wish to deal with. Talk 
about an annoying thought process. It owuld be nice to be able to figure out 
once and for all what this life is all about. I can read the scriptures and 
everything, my mind keeps asking questions. I do not know what to do with those 
questions though. I think that's were the problem lays.
  Questions are natural. Questions come because people are inquiring of things. 
They wonder about life. They wonder about everything that comes to their mind. 
What is a person supposed to do about any of that then? If they have questions 
they ask. If they ask? They get in trouble. That's where this life can lead you. 
To a deep dark troubling issue. If you end up in trouble? Where do you end up 
going?
  It doesn't quite make sense now does it. No, I didn't think it would. Whatever 
the case? There has got to be a reason behind all of it. Well I think there has 
to be a reason? I don't know. If there's not a reason? We end up in trouble.
  I can only guess what's to happen in the next life to come. We have teachings 
this is true, but where does my actual soul belong? That is one of the many 
questions which worry me.
