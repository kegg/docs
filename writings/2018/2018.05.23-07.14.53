  Today is not the best of days so far. Life is turned upside down at the 
moment. House guests. Who don't go home until Saturday. I'm not sure how much 
longer I can deal with this. I have to hang in there.
  I have a doctor appointment today. Should be fun. Not. When has the doctors 
ever been fun? Exactly. It hasn't. They'll check my potassium level and whatever 
the other doctor at the ER gave me about those lymph nodes on my abdomen. So 
that'll work I guess.
  I'm just really not a fan of going to the doctor. I doubt anyone is a fan. But 
that's another story for another time.
