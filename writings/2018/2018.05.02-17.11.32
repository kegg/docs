  Oh life, where have you come to? Where are you headed? There are so many ideas 
and options out there I don't quite understand or realize all that is happening. 
I wish life was a bit better at times. There's no telling what happens with any 
of it. I mean, here we are. Living a life, having an experience. Everything 
comes and goes the way it's meant to. Yet we don't know what's going to happen 
now do we. No, I don't really believe we do. It happens. Life gets destroyed and 
here we are...allowing it to destroy us.
  If we had an answer. Maybe we could figure things out. This life wouldn't be 
as complicated as it is now. It could be better. Might be something we could 
actually live with and understand...perhaps grasp. Either way? It's a life 
waiting to be destroyed.
