  I suppose there could be something out of this life that would make sense. 
perhaps it't not really meant to be. Such a waste of time. Maybe not, but well 
that's what it is. Life has a way of just kicking you around at times. I don't 
know what to think about that most days. But if I did? I'm sure I would be able 
to pick it out in a lineup of sorts. Either way, life is life and that's all 
which matters.
  Unless you decide to do something else. Then life becomes something quite 
different. Life comes along and makes you wish and hope for things that aren't 
the same as the others. Everything destroys itself and becomes clear in the end. 
This life will eventually destroy you. That's how the end comes. That's what 
will happen. There's no other way this life will end.
  For all things must come to an end...eventually.
