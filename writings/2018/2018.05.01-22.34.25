  Another day is now complete. There are times in this life where tired doesn't 
begin to describe any of it. My brain has turned to goo. There doesn't feel like 
there's anything left in my mind. I understand that. I grasp that. That's okay 
for me to understand...I think. Maybe. I don't know. Who's to understand any of 
it? If I could fully grasp what is happening in my mind, I would gladly say it. 
But for now, I am at a loss.
  Went to the doctor today. I either have a cyst or cancer in my face. Awesome. 
They're going to do a biospy. Been kind of worried about it for a while now. But 
finally I will be able to have it taken care of. So that's a positive thing.
  Going to take care of the rash I have going on too. Psiorisis really isn't 
fun. I know I didn't spell that word correctly, but I didn't want to bother look 
it up. Like I said, I'm rather tired at the moment. Awesome.
