  There needs to be a way to simply exist. Something out there must allow for 
such a concept? Perhaps not. Yet, if we do exist and nothing else is to be had 
from it all, I suppose we aren't growing. Growth is the key to life. It's not 
really the best idea or option at times. But hey, it's growth right? Yes, 
something like that. Growth to do that which you need to do. To be able to have 
that peace of mind to continue working towards that greater good.
  Whatever the case, growth seems and appears to come and go at will. Who's will 
that is? I'm not certain. It would be nice to find out someday.
