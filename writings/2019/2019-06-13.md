# I don't want to think
## Jun 13, 2019

There are days where I simply don't want to think. I don't want to have to think 
about anything. Is that wrong? I'm not sure. Is that okay? Nope, still not sure. 
It would be nice to be able to figure out everything that occurs in this life 
and yet here we all are, hoping something will happen. yet we simply don't know 
or fully understand what will happen or when that will occur. So that's life 
right now. Just deal with it I suppose.
