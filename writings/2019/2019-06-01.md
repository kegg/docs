# Another Day
## Jun 1, 2019

Just another day, there's not much to say. It's simply a day. Not easy when 
people aren't around and things just aren't the same. But you hope and wish 
everything was alright, that things would be fine. Maybe they will be, maybe 
they won't be. Who's to know what's ever to happen? I do not know.
