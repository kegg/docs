# Not Only Today
## Jul 24, 2019

There are thoughts that go through my head a lot. Sometimes it's on a daily 
basis. It's not only a one day kind of thing. So they stick around and there's 
nothing I can do about it. Seriously. It would be nice to be able to do 
something about the thoughts, but for now I can't. I just have to deal with 
them, and that really sucks.
