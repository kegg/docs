# Meh Life
## Jun 15, 2019

Another day passes. Just another day comes to light. Is that enough to figure out?
I'm not sure. Such a thought process consumes my mind at times. It comes and goes
long out into the night, and here we all are.

There's nothing wrong with wondering and guessing about anything and everything
which comes along in this life. Here we are simply waiting for something better
to happen and occur. Life comes and goes, there's nothing wrong with that at all.
