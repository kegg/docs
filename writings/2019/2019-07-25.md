# I Don't Know How
## Jul 25, 2019

I don't know how to move on. I don't know how to do anything right now. I'm just 
here waiting for whatever seems like whatever and will happen. It has to stop at 
some point, has to be okay again somehow in my head. I don't know how that will 
look, or what it will look like at all.
