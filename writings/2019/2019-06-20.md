# What A Life
## Jun 20, 2019

What a life indeed. Each of us come into this world to try and figure out 
things. Life has a way to make us think and consider whatever is going on, it 
must find a way to allow us to figure it all out. We don't always figure things 
out of course, that's not how this life always works. It comes and goes long 
before we even have a chance to attempt any of it. Talk about a twist that just 
doesn't make sense.
