# What If
## May 31, 2019

Ever have a moment of "what if"? Pop into your head? What if I did this, what if

Things like that? I'm sure a lot of people have those kinds of thoughts daily. 
It happens. There's nothing wrong with it, I suppose? Maybe there is. I don't 
know. Life comes and goes as it is, and it simply is not enough to understand 
the basics of it all.
