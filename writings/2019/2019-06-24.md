# What Is Going On
## Jun 24, 2019

What exactly is going on in this life we live in? I do not know. I haven't the 
faintest idea of anything that happens. I simply know I am living here and is 
that enough? Is that enough to make things work? Is it enough to enable life to 
be something better than it is? I do not know. I simply don't have any idea of 
what is going on. I don't understand or realize any of it. I wish I did. Yet 
here we are waiting for something better to come around. Something much much 
better to have an understanding of. Is that not the end goal of life? To better 
understand each other and ourselves as much as possible?
