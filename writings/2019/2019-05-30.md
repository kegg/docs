# What Really Is Life
## May 30, 2019

If life is meant to be taken seriously, and we are here just doing whatever; is 
that really taking anything seriously? I'm not sure. I would probably say no at 
this point in time. So many worries in this life and there's nothing that makes 
sense. Life continues to just be out there without the ability to determine the 
full truth of any matter. I would dare say it is quite unique to everyone yet 
everyone has such an experience. If that makes any sense.
