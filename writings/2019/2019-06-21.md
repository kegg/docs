# Why Worry
## Jun 21, 2019

Worry doesn't work most of the time. It comes and goes as it will. So why bother 
with any of it? There's no reason to worry about anything. Life moves along as 
it will go and you just have to swim along the current long enough to figure it 
out. If you can do that, there's nothing to worry about at that point. The worry 
won't matter, as life won't matter. Simple as that? Perhaps.
