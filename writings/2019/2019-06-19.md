# Why Does It Matter?
## Jun 19, 2019

One would think this life would actually make some kind of sense eventually. I 
mean shouldn't it? Maybe it would, maybe it wouldn't. I'm not sure. But you know 
what they say about not being sure. Life finds a way to make sure you're sure 
about something sometime in the future. Sure it might not happen right now, but 
it will happen someday. So that all works out. Whatever the case, life finds a 
way to do something with you. If you choose to go along with it? Fine. If you 
don't? That's fine too.
