# Doesn't Matter
## Jul 26, 2019

There are so many things in this life which simply don't matter. Why should they 
matter? Who cares if they matter or not? It shouldn't matter. It shouldn't be 
worried about. There's no reason for anything to be worried about at all. That's 
what life does to you. You worry and then you go away. Everything eventually 
ends and it all becomes nothing.
