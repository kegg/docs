# Life What Is It?
# May 23, 2019

People are always saying this and that about life. What exactly are they talking 
about? Doesn't quite make sense if you ask me. But well people don't ask me now 
do they, I don't suppose that's part of it all. Life has a way of simply 
being...something. Something you don't fully understand or grasp to something 
which doesn't matter. Maybe it does, who knows. Yet here we are simply trying to 
get by and understand whatever it is we're meant to grasp and latch onto. 
Doesn't make it easier to understand at all.
