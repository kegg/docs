# Life What Is It?
# May 23, 2019

People are always saying this and that about life. What exactly are they talking 
about? Doesn't quite make sense if you ask me. But well people don't ask me now 
do they, I don't suppose that's part of it all. Life has a way of simply 
being...something. Something you don't fully understand or grasp to something 
which doesn't matter. Maybe it does, who knows. Yet here we are simply trying to 
get by and understand whatever it is we're meant to grasp and latch onto. 
Doesn't make it easier to understand at all.

Let's imagine for a moment that life actually mattered... I mean does it matter? 
I'm not sure. It would be nice to know if something mattered in this life. yet 
we simply do not know if anything will ever matter now will we. No, I didn't 
think so. that happens though. It's okay for that to happen...I think? Maybe 
it's not. Whatever the case, this life will continue on with or without you. 
There's no reason to actually believe something better will come along if you're 
sitting there wondering what's more to it all. There's nothing.
