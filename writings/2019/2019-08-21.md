# Whatever
## Aug 21, 2019

So many thoughts come to mind these days. There's nothing really you can do 
without going crazy. I know it's all part of this life, but this life doesn't 
have to be part of it. Does that make sense? I'm not sure. It would be nice if I 
could figure out whatever goes on in this life, have it make some kind of sense. 
But well, we simply don't have the answers to any of it. So here we sit.
