# Nothing Matters
## Jun 18, 2019

Nothing really matters anymore. There's nothing worth anything. Here we live and 
here we always will be. Why should one bother with that which they cannot 
change? However, there are things in life which you have the ability to change 
and have control over. Change those things and you will be able to see something 
better in the future because of it.
