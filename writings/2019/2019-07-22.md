# Why Does It Exist
## Jul 22, 2019

Why do things exist? Why exactly does that one thing exist? Doesn't make sense. 
There should be enough reasons for something to exist, yet they don't always 
exist for anything and everything. So here we are. Why does that exist? Does it 
make sense for it to be there? Does it make sense for it to actually be there? 
It doesn't matter does it? I'm not sure.
