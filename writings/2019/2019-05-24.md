# Silly Weird Thoughts
## May 24, 2019

Today has to get better. There's nothing wrong with thinking that. It will get 
better right? Everything has a purpose supposedly...this is just a trial? I 
don't know what this is. Things get better? I think? I hope? Maybe? Who really 
knows what goes on in this life. It's just a life...just a silly stupid life 
which doesn't make sense. So here we sit waiting for something to happen. Will 
it ever happen? I don't know. It's just a life ya know? yeah...something like 
that.
