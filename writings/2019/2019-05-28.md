# Silly Weird Things
## May 28, 2019

Life doesn't always work out the way you wanted it to, or hope it to, or expect 
it to. Life just doesn't work out that way. It is destructive and intrusive. It 
will destroy you. No matter where you go in life, you are bound to be destroyed. 
You can build yourself back up, but you have to be destroyed first. Don't ask me 
what that means. I have no idea...it's just a running thought in my head at 
times.

Does that mean anything? I don't know. Should it? Who knows. Who cares. Life is 
like that a lot...a lot of things just don't matter anymore and here we are 
walking around in circles waiting for something to come along and take control 
from us. Whatever it is, it will find a way. So that's life in a nutshell.
