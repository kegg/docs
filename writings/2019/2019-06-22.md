# Life Isn't Worth It
## Jun 22, 2019

Life really doesn't feel worth it anymore. I don't know what to think about anything.
Just feels like this life isn't worth living. Is there a way out? I'm not sure. It
would be nice if there was, it wo uld be nice if I could figure out a way to get
away from it all. But I can't. So here I am.
