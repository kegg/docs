# Not Everything Makes Sense
## Jun 6, 2019

There are times in this life where not everything makes much sense. We are here 
and that's all which matters the most. Life comes and goes, we are simply 
waiting for the end to find its way to us. Or are we? Maybe we are the ones who 
should be looking for something better in this life. There doesn't appear to be 
much in the way of that, just a life where we hope and wish for something good 
to happen to us. Doesn't mean something good will happen, just that we hope for 
something good to take place.
