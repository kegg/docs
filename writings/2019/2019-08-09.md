So there are thoughts that cannot be shared at times. Life doesn't do what you 
want it to do. Life happens and you just have to deal with whatever comes your

So life comes along and you have to decide what you're going to do with it. You 
just have to think and do. Sometimes, there's no thinking. You just have to do.
