# Don't Think
## Jul 9, 2019

There's no reason to think about anything. Life happens. Life comes by and 
tosses us aside from wherever we end up and wherever we go. There's no reason to 
let anything happen beyond it all. Life will end. No matter where we go in this 
life, it will come to an end. That's how everyone gets out of here.
