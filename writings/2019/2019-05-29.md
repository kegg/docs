# Is this life?
## May 29, 2019

There are so many thoughts out there I simply cannot comprehend them all...yet I 
try and here we are again. Does it matter? Does it work out the way you want it 
to? Will everything fully have a way to figure itself out? I doubt it. I don't 
think there is anything a person can do to make it all work out just fine the 
way they want it to happen. That's not how this life works fully. It's not how 
this life is meant to work, yet here we are. Waiting. Wondering. Hoping. For 
something to get better than we have it. For something to make sense.
