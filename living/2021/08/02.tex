Been writing more in my religion document. There are so many interesting things
from history upon which I can bring to light in my own mind. Not everything is
good mind you, but a lot can be taken into account.

Learning truth of things is not always easy. Sometimes you just have to sit down
and learn them. I alone decided to take this journey. No one forced me to. Yet
why am I reluctant to continue it? Doesn't make sense does it. Considering I
sat down this morning to continue the work.
