Thoughts come and go at times. Sometimes they are worse than others. Then there are
those thoughts which cannot leave. Teachings of prophets are in conflict with other
prophets. Those teachings confuse people. What once was doctrine is now determined to
be false. Yet those people who followed those teachings are rewarded because they
simply followed a prophet speaking for God. So if they are speaking for God, does
that mean God changes His mind in regards to doctrine? Eternal doctrine that has been
since before the world was? How can there be so many differences over the years?
