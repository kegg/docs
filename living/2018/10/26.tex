\section{Fri, Oct 26, 2018}

Today is another Friday. It is a good thing I would suppose and hope for. I mean here
we are simply stating that the weekend is here. We can relax and enjoy that which we
are able to. It means nothing more than that. To be able to sit down and simply rest,
it is a good feeling.

There are some questions that come to mind at times. If that can be an accurate
statement. Sometimes those questions aren't easy to come by. Sometimes they aren't
easy to answer. Either way, we have questions. Questions which need to be answered.
Is that a bad thing? I'm not sure. It would be nice to be able to simply let it all
go by the wayside and just not worry about any of it.

Yet here I am. Wondering about things and how they end up being. Why are so many
things simply being in the way? Why must they have issues with life? It doesn't make
sense, it doesn't matter at times. Everything must be able to have peace. There must
be a way to find peace.\footnote{What exactly is peace though? People want peace all 
their days and they cannot find it. So, what causes peace to come down from whatever
place it is meant to come down? Doesn't make sense does it? No, I didn't think so.}
