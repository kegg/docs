Ah, Toxic People in our lives. Such a terrible thing to have to go through. Sometimes
that is an actual person, or it could be an insitution. Either way, toxic people are
toxic. Institution toxic people are the worst, to my own belief, because the
institution creates toxic people. It's not just one person. The whole of the people
begin to believe what one man believes. He says to jump, the only ask how high and
start jumping before even thinking about asking how high. It's a cult like thought
process.
