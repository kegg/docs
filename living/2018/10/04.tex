General Conference is coming up. That can be a good thing. I wonder what they'll
announce at it. Is that wrong? I mean people keep saying that President Nelson is all
about revelation, a a rush of revelation, and a snowflake in a snowstorm kind of
thing. If those things are to be believed, then supposedly there should be some kind
of revelation at this next General Conference. However, the types of revelation that
have been revealed have been more of a business standpoint, nothing really spiritual
as of yet...so um yeah, that's where we sit at the moment.
