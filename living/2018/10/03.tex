Wednesday, what is there to say about you exactly? I mean, here we are, it's the middle
of the week and what do we have to show for it? Who's to say what will happen when every
other thing in the world goes kapoof?\footnote{Is that even a word? I doubt it, but I
like it!} Then we come to other things that occur in the day. What are those things?
Well, people go to work. People exist. People do whatever they need to do in order
to survive. Is that not the case? Is that not what people do day in and day out? Survive
to another day? Yeah, something like that.
