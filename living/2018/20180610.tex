Living a life that's free. It's not always the easiest route to take for there
are many obstacles in this life which we must overcome. There is in this life a
purpose for all things. Things which we do not fully understand or grasp at any
given moment in time. But as we learn, we will eventually undersrtand that which
is to be understood.

So, here we are. What are we to do with such knolwedge?

It is quite a unique experience to try and understand that which we do not. To
grab hold of things as we know them today vs. what we know of tomorrow. Either
way, this life will come and go and we will have knowledge of which was left
behind. Where will we stand at that day?
