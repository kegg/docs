\section{Wed, Aug 22, 2018}\footnote{Day 3}

It is but another day, I can deal with that. Not a bad thing to have happen during
the week. It comes and goes as it pleases. Everything in balance as it were. Today is
the start of school for kiddos, that is always a welcome delight. They get learning
in, and the parents get to help with homework... or something like that. But
education is a good thing for sure.
