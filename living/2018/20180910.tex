Another week is upon us. Had an uneventful weekend. It was alright.

I remembered my Oreo's and everything else I forgot last week. Yay! That's a good
thing for sure.

There are so many thoughts in my head today. I'm not certain about what to do with
any of them. They come and go and sit and wait to be thought about. Yet here they are
seeming to me as they were always meant to be there. Whatever the case, these
thoughts wish to remain and so here I am doing my thing without hope that these
thoughts will remedy themselves.

These thoughts have to mainly to do with religion. Yes religion has been on my mind
quite a bit lately, is there ever a time when I do not talk about religion these
days? I am not certain. But if truth is to be found, it must be talked about.
