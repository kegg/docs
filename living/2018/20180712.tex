Somedays you just have to take a look at something, anything, be it math even
and see what it does. Maximum values, Minimum values. Values of all kinds. Each
have a story to tell.

Then there are days that you don't want to believe or think about such matters.
But it happens. No matter what, life is always there. It's not going anywhere
for the most part. It'll let you know what's going on.
