Tuesday, what on earth do you say about a Tuesday exactly? I mean, it's a day. It's
the second day of the week granted, but it's just another day. There's not much to be
said about today. Sure it's a Utah holiday, whatever. That's nothing special, not
when you have to work on the holiday. So there's that. Forget the holiday aspect of
today. Nope, no reason to deal with that.

What else is there about today that makes it special?

Haven't a clue.

However, I did find this happy image. Sure it's photoshopped, but it's still fun:

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{2018/images/truth.jpg}
  \caption{Truth}
  \label{fig:truth}
\end{figure}

We have been charged to find the truth in all things. If it contains not the truth
then it should be \st{destroyed}\footnote{Destroyed might be the wrong word here, 
dismissed maybe would be better?}. It's really that simple, is it not? I would think 
it to be.
