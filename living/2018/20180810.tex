Another day to see the world. Yet here we sit waiting for something to take place and
it will never happen. Seeing the world isn't always a must thing to do, but it can
be. Okay that didn't make sense. It's a thing you want to do, it's a wish. Everyone
has a wish at times. Not everyone can fulfill their wishes though, and that's a
shame. I suppose that's why they call them dreams. A person can dream, but that deam
might never come true. A shame.
