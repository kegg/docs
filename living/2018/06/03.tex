Oh what a day today has been. It is but a Sunday. I do not feel any different
now then I ever did on a Sunday. Perhaps my mind doesn't know how to accept that
which it cannot accept? I do not know the meaning of such language, however here
I am and that is all which matters. I'm sure the church people will get ahold of
me eventually. But it is of no concern to me.

I do what I do, and I try what I try. There is no reason for any of this
nonsense to follow me. If it does follow me? Then it will follow me. Again, I
see no reason for it to have any kind of impact on my life.

Now if you were to ask my parents about such things, they would tell you I am a
child of hell and will be going there after this life is over. That may be the
case, but if what I've learned about heaven is true I'd rather not go there to
begin with. Whatever the case this life will continue to be whatever it will be
and there is nothing wrong with that to me.
