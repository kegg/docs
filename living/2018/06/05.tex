Life is difficult at times. Today is one of those days where it is extremely
hard. I don't want to talk about it, but I need to talk about it. Yes it's one
of those days indeed.

Money is always an issue when it comes to life. I wish we didn't have to deal
with money problems. That would be great. A better alternative to it? I do not
have the faintest idea of what that could be. But something different would be
amazing right now.

But we have to deal with money. It's really a root of evil in my opinion.
Whatever happens happens though. I just hope it will happen sooner rather than
later.
