\section{Thu, Jun 21, 2018}

Welcome Thursday, another day is here to wreck upon our lives and seem to
destory us. Okay, that might have been a bit of an overstep. There's no such
thing that would happen... right? Right. At least I don't think that would
happen. It's life though, and life means that we come and go as we do and see
all there is to see..waiting for a better day to arrive. I think? Something like
that.

Sometimes there are limitations in life. The above script won't compile in ant
without a later version...found that out the hard way. That's why life changes.
It changes accomodate new features, yet it also changes to mess with those
features at times.\footnote{
Specifically, it won't compile under JDK1.8 if you're running ANT 1.8.4. You
have to upgrade your ant version, or specify an executable attribute on the
javac task. For example, specifying a JDK1.7 on the javac task, it will run
without problem. To fix this would easily be to update ANT to 1.9.3.
