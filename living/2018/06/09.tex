Why does life feel so difficult at times? It doesn't make sense. I wish it would
actually make some kind of sense, but it doesn't. So here we sit waiting for
whatever to come along. One would think it could make some sort of sense? Maybe
not. Who's to know exactly what kind of sense it's meant to have.

Whatever the case, here we are. Simply waiting for something better to come
along.

This life is so short. People come and go in and out of it without any kind of
notice. Some people die before they were expected to. It's a tragic loss when
that happens. No one deserves to die at young ages, they have so much to live
for. But I suppose if it's in God's plan, then it's meant to be. I feel that's a
shallow answer for complex situations at times. I suppose that's where the whole
believe in faith comes in. Which is another issue I have. But well, that's
something different for sure.
