What determines faith exactly? What determines right and wrong according to a
religion? What determines that the thoughts and teachings passed down from
generation to generation are right and true? Family members scold you for not
following their wishes. Those things they brought you up with. Those things they
expect you to follow no matter what.

It becomes confusing.

More confusing than anything else. Confusing in the fact they won't allow you to
live your own life. They want you to follow in their footsteps without
questioning any of it. There is no room for error. No margin to allow you to
simply be yourself. It is their way or the highway after all.

Personally I don't believe God would intend his children to be brainwashed like
this. To destroy them mentally in such a manner? I don't believe it for a
second. It's a mess. A complete mess that makes people wish they didn't exist.
It sickens me to my stomach, I cannot breathe when I think of such things.
