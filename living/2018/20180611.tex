Today is but a day. Another day upon which we all live. There is nothing better
than that which we can do. To each their own, we are meant to continue forward
and onward to that which is great and wonderful. Whatever that may be, whatever
that is, we are to find it. How do we find things of such magnitude? You have to
reach out and grab it. Whatever it is. Look and see what you are able to find.
That is all.
