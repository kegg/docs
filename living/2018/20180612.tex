It is a simple commandline output program. To say hello to a computer system. Or
rather for a computer system to say hello to the user. It's nothing special per
se, but it is quite an interesting thing. I once wrote a computer program to
tell me it loved me. How nice and thoughtful was that? Exactly.

Shall we see what that program looks like? I don't see why not.

Again, it's a simple program. But it allows for you to see the date the program
says I love you too! Is it stupid? Maybe. Does it help my sanity? Yes. So is it
really stupid? Nope! Not in the least. It's a thing, an important thing. And if
it's a computer telling me I'm loved? So be it!

Either way? Life is life and here I am living it. It's not the perfect dream,
no, no it's not. But it is something I enjoy at times. Do I enjoy life all of
the time? I doubt it. That's not the point. The point is I'm pushing through and
I keep on going. That's all there is to it.

Args are a wonderful thing to put in a program. They allow you to interact with
programs. Interacting with programs are a fun way to personalize them. But more
importantly to configure them. You can pass in a parameter to output a greeting,
you can use a parameter to tell the program to do different things. The sky is
the limit!
