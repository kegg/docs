That quote is from the Improvement Era, Nov 1966, Page 979.

There's an interesting quote if you ask me. They're called as special witnesses of
Christ, but that appears to be in name only these days. In the old world, and in the
americas when Christ visited they were actual witnesses of Christ. For they saw and
talked and walked with Him. Now adays? Not so much.
