\st{Feel like crud today. Is there anything better than that? Heh, let's try that
again.} Naturally when someone doesn't feel good, they just feel like crud. I wish
there was something that could make me feel better. But there isn't. I just have to
deal with it and get over whatever there is that's going on...isn't that how things
work? Yeah, something like that. \st{Perhaps there's a reason I feel like this. Or
maybe not. People just get sick. Immune systems aren't all they're cracked up to be.}
It would be nice to feel better. I won't lie...it would really be nice to feel better
than I currently do. But we'll just have to wait it out and see what happens.

I am reminded of a scripture:

\begin{displayquote}
Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and 
I forgive him? till seven times?

Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy 
times seven.\footnote{Matthew 18:21-22}
\end{displayquote}

Not everyone understands this and are hasty to judge and hold people accountable for
something that isn't really that important to overthink. It kinda hurts the brain and
thought process as things go. It's a sad state of affairs in that case.
