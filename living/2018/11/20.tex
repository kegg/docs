\st{Tuesday. What a silly name for a day of the week. Honestly.} Oh what a day 
already this has been. There shouold be something better than the second day of the
week. Something has to be better than today. I'm sure it will get better, but it's so
darn cold outside right now. I'm not sure what's going on with any of it. I mean,
here we are living in a cold state, and what's there to be done regarding it? I'm not
sure. Let's just hope it will get better...warmer? Something like that.

\st{There are days that you just wish could evaporate into nothing. Perhaps something
to be done about it all? I'm not sure. Whatever it is, it will find a way to simply
be done with.}

In a few days it will be Turkey Day... well Thanksgiving is the actual name of the
day. So many things to be thankful for. We have things we should be thankful for year
round, yet it doesn't always come off like that. Sometimes people wait to see what's
going on in life and how everything else will end up being. It's just a life in which
we have to be thankful for.
