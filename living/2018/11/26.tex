There's a reason certain questions always pop up. There's a reason those same
questions have been popping up for years. It's because there hasn't been a sincere
answer to any of it. Instead, we get taught to doubt our doubts before we doubt our
faith.\footnote{Come, Join with Us, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, October 2013 
General Conference}

Why is that? Why can't the questions be answered? God saw in infinate wisdom to
supply Nephi with the idea to write down the things that would be lost by Martin
Harris. Why couldn't God forsee that which would happen in regards to the questions
that would appear before us today?
