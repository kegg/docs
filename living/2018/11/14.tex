There comes a day when life is just life. It doesn't always happen that way.
Sometimes we are simply just living here. There needs to be a reason for it. Reasons
must come and go from time to time...that's okay to try to grasp. It's not always an
easy explaination.

Random thoughts coming to my mind today. They deal with the church as usual.

1. On my mission, one of my companions didn't like how I taught the Joseph Smith part
of the 1st discussion. I had stated that Joseph prayed vocally, that it had been his
first time praying vocally. My companion called it false doctrine, and told me not to
say that again. How is it false if it's in the Pearl of Great Price?

\begin{displayquote}
...It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all 
my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally.\footnote{JSH 1:14}
\end{displayquote}

I found it odd that he would chastize me for telling the truth. I thought it was a
nice little thought to the narrative and wanted to include it. Obviously he felt
otherwise, going as far as making an example out of me during a district meeting.

2. Being told to be bold in my beliefs...but I don't believe so I'm to be bold in the
things I have learned. To bring down thoughts and years of conditioning is not an
easy task. Being told to study, so I study. Then I find out the truth from my
studies, where does that bring me? Where has all of that studying been taking me?
