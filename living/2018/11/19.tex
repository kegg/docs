Ah another week is upon us. What's there to be said about it? I'm not
sure, well is anyone ever really sure about what's going on? Some 
might argue it's a new week, so what. While others might have you wonder
what there is to be said about it all. Who's to say exactly anything?

There was a time in my life where I figured everything would be simple, just
have to keep my nose clean and follow the brethren. Wouldn't have to worry
about anything if I did those simple things. Wouldn't have to worry or
think about what was right or wrong in my mind, wouldn't have to do any
kind of thinking.

Well, that kind of process can only take you so far. Eventually you have
to decide for yourself if it's right or wrong in your own mind. You have
to study it out and see what possibilities are out there. I'm not saying
I've found something exactly...I'm not certain what it is I have found.
It's a journey to be sure.
