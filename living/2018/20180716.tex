Aother weekend is over. A week is just beginning. It is what it is mostly a day
where things happen. Nothing happens because it wants to of course. There is
always a cause and a reaction to an event. This is what life is made for. This
is what life is about. At least I believe that's what it is all about. Who is to
know exactly what life is meant to be?

There are days in this life where we all just want to simply sleep away. There's
nothing wrong with that thinking. However, it must needs be to have some sort of
accurate representation upon the world as a whole. Or upon ones self as a whole.
To be accepted in the world and not of yourself doesn't hold much merrit. Sure
you have the world to thank for your achievements, but if you do not accept
yourself, what have you then? A blank slate. A person who doesn't wish to be
here. That is all there is in life at that point. It  doesn't matter much beyond
anything else.

So here we are. Simply trying to live a life that is worth living. Seeing out
there the things which are meant to be seen. Enjoying everything there is to be
enjoyed without causing harm to ourselves.

It is an adventure at least. Perhaps a misadventure. Either way, we are here and
that's all which matters.
