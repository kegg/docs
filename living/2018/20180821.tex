\section{Tue, Aug 21, 2018}\footnote{Day 2}

It is another day. A new day to grab hold of something and simply let go. Be guarded
of course of all there is to grasp and understand, but in the end to let it all go.
The guilt and remorse will be round for a bit, that is understandable and O.K. It
will eventually pass. It has to pass right? I sure hope it will pass. if it doesn't,
then there's nothing to accept for any of it.
