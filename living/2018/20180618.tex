Yesterday was Father's Day. I took a day off of life...I think that's what I
did, I'm not quite sure what I did about any of it. It was nice though. Just
sitting back and relaxing doing nothing. Did I mention it was nice? Because it
was nice.

So today is another day. That's fine. The thoughts and processes of this life
continue to come out and create havoc in the world around us. Trying to find the
source of some quotes in this life are even worse. But here we are trying just
to live to the best of our ability. That's okay to do. We are only human as it
were.\footnote{As It Were: In a way (used to be less precise). Well now, that's 
an interesting turn of events don't you think? Perhaps this life isn't meant to
be understood completely. We are just here for the ride of it all. Nothing
matters. Nothing at all. Life comes at us, and we're here just hoping and
wishing it was better than it was. We can make it better. But there are
things which are not in our control. We can't have control over everything which
happens in this life. That's just how this life is.}
