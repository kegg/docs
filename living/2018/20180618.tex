Yesterday was Father's Day. I took a day off of life...I think that's what I
did, I'm not quite sure what I did about any of it. It was nice though. Just
sitting back and relaxing doing nothing. Did I mention it was nice? Because it
was nice.

So today is another day. That's fine. The thoughts and processes of this life
continue to come out and create havoc in the world around us. Trying to find the
source of some quotes in this life are even worse. But here we are trying just
to live to the best of our ability. That's okay to do. We are only human as it
were.
