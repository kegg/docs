Life is just being silly right now. I wake up tired, go to bed tired, just always
tired. I'm not sure if it's stress or something else. Either way, I'll get through
it, just have to take time.

It would be interesting to write a ``day in the life" kind of article. It wouldn't be
much more than what I'm writing here I guess, except more detail? Yeah something like
that. I wonder exactly what it would have in it though. I suppose I'd just have to
actually start writing it and see where it leads. Yes, that could be an exciting
\st{thought} project. It would be more than a thought, it would be an actual book a
project which would make things shine and people wonder what in the world I was doing
to even begin such an endeavor. Oh to make them wonder.

But wonder alone would not be enough, to cause somoene to actually read it and grab
hold of what thoughts cross my  mind on a daily basis, yes that would be the
adventure.
