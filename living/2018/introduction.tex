\section*{Introduction}

What in the world is a journal for? I mean we keep journals, we keep diaries, we keep
things so our children, our grandchildren etc. will be able to read about our lives.
Is that not the purpose for keeping a journal?

Even people of old kept a history of their day to day life. Some became scripture.
While others were just more secular in nature. I've no idea what this will become,
maybe a mixture of both. Who's to know, who's to say. It will become whatever it will
become, and that is fine with me.
