Another day...almost the end of the week. That would be a good thing right? The end of the week? 
Yes, something like that. Perhaps life will eventually come to make sense in some form of the word.
Who knows exactly what will happen when this life does its thing. I mean, there are and can be 
a couple of different thoughts out there in the world. There isn't anything else which can happen
that isn't allowd to take place. If you are under the impression life will change because you will it
to be that way? I don't think it will really change. Circumstances are those that your life is
what it is and there's nothing wrong with that. Yes you can influence change, but directly change
your entire life and circumstances? No, that doesn't happen. You will always have the same
background you had yesterday, you cannot change the past; only the future going forward.
