I feel like screaming. Is that an okay thing to do today? I sure hope so, because
well here I am ready to scream. So many thoughts are occurring right now and I'm not
sure where they are going to go or how they will end up. There needs to be a way to
have something done because of it all. Yet I do not know how to go about it. So, I
will sit here and wait for something to happen. Is that wrong? I do not know.

Waiting can be a bad thing, if I wait for something to happen it might never happen
at all. That would be a case of a bad thing. However, if I take the initative and
step forward and make a move? Something could happen. That could possibly be a good
thing right? One would hope so. It could also turn out to be a bad thing.

I think either way I think about it or do something I'm kinda messed up. So there's
that. Oh well, life will find a way to overcome whatever there is to overcome. I can
be content with that thought. Well I think I can be content with that thought. Who
knows.

There are some things that shouldn't be asked of people, of any age. But I suppose
that's what sets me apart from the church. They don't need to pry. They don't need to
get deep into any of it. Leave it at a light simple thing and let it go. What the
hell.
