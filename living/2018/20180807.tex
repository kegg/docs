\centerline{Part of me wonders why I am sad.}

Even when I was at my strongest, and I was doing everything I could for church and
state, I wasn't happy. I was depressed, sad, down. There wasn't anything that could
``fix" the situation I was in. I have found as time moved on, I haven't ever stepped
out of that place in life. Here I am just living day to day wondering when something
will get better.

Will it ever get better? I've been told by some that it will. I have taken the steps
they have told me to take, and it hasn't done much for anything. I am still the same
person I was over a decade ago. So, where does that leave me? Where do I go from this
point in life and where will I end up?
