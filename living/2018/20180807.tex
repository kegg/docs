\centerline{Part of me wonders why I am sad.}

Even when I was at my strongest, and I was doing everything I could for church and
state, I wasn't happy. I was depressed, sad, down. There wasn't anything that could
``fix" the situation I was in. I have found as time moved on, I haven't ever stepped
out of that place in life. Here I am just living day to day wondering when something
will get better.

Will it ever get better? I've been told by some that it will. I have taken the steps
they have told me to take, and it hasn't done much for anything. I am still the same
person I was over a decade ago. So, where does that leave me? Where do I go from this
point in life and where will I end up?

Had a panic attack today. It lasted about 30 minutes this time around. That's not
good, it could be worse of course. But it's still not good. Finally calming down now.
Darn panic attacks.
