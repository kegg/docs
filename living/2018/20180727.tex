The weekend is here, well it's coming. Today is Friday. The weekend isn't fully here
yet. But it is on its way and that is good enough for me to handle. So here we are at
the final stretches of the week. Some things have been learned this week. Some to
make one angry, upset, and a whole range of other emotions. But there are other
things which do not cause such grief. Happiness tends to come around in different
ways, and that is good.

To be happy is not always a thing to be found in this life. There are so many
opportunities to feel any emotion during a given week. So many places to go and find
and see the many different aspects of life. Yet if a person isn't to be found holding
onto traditions they once grew up with as a child, they are frowned upon. I have
found that to be the case many times in my life.
