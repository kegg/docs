Tis Sunday. There's nothing wrong with it being a Sunday mind you. But it is Sunday
and that is okay with me. I think. Maybe. Who's to say if it's okay or not? Today is
but a day of rest, and here we are resting from our labours. That way we are able to
continue onward tomorrow and see all there is to see out in the world. Maybe if we
are lucky, we can see things which are meant to be seen, and that which is meant to
be seen we can see. Trust me, it made sense a second ago.

Been reading lately in the journals of one William Clayton. Came across this unique
piece of history:

Take it as you will.
