What's in a day exactly? I mean what makes people go forward and do everything they
can to get through a day? It makes me wonder at times how such days become
accomplished.

So many thoughts come to a person's mind in the course of a day. Some thoughts are
good other thoughts are not meant to build a person up but tear them down. It is an
odd thing to be sure, and an even worse thing upon which we can crumble if this life
destroys us all in an instant.

Thoughts have the ability to do so many things to a person. It really is interesting
how the human brain does its thing. Everything is controlled by the brain. Impuleses
and nerves and all of that sciency stuff which I don't understand. I do know it
houses our mind, our thoughts, everything we do happens because something fires off
in the brain to do it.

Not sure what I'm trying to say here even. I guess I have a few thoughts popping
around in my head today. Is that a good thing? Is it a bad thing? I'm not sure. It's
just a thing, maybe that's all it needs to be. A thing and I will leave it at that.
