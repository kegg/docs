Representatives from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints dropped by
lastnight. With the new information about not using Mormon or LDS in most cases,
that's exactly who they were. I find myself wondering why they decided to come across
my door. I have ideas, but well I'd rather not go into them. My doubts are evident,
perhaps they are trying to save my soul and have me come back to church. Whatever the
case, it's just life right? I can deal.
