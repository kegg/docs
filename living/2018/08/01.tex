A new month. New experiences to be had. A life worth living? Perhaps. A life worth
dying for? Well, everone dies eventually right? yeah, something like that. Either
way, it is a life. Is that too much to ask for? Is that too much to say about it all?
I do not know. It will always be this way. Either you live or you die. There is no
other option.

Some would think this life is full of happy places and everything else. It is not
always the case. There are always issues which come up during this life. There are so
many things which happen and which people don't have control over. They look towards
a God or Gods and hope for the best. Some claim to know these Gods are looking out
for them and will help them no matter what.
