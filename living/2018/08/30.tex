This quote hits deep today:

\begin{displayquote}
When the culture of any organization mandates that it is more important to protect
the reputation of a system and those in power than it is to protect the basic human
dignity of the individuals that serve the system or who are served by the system, you
can be certain the shame is systemic, the money is driving the ethics, and the
accountability is all but dead.\footnote{Brene Brown}
\end{displayquote}

Allow me to put it in a more formal picture, as it were:

\begin{figure}[h!]

  \caption{Protecting an Organization}
  \label{fig:protect}
\end{figure}

Yeah, so there's that.
