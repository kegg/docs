Another day is here. Sound like a broken record. Yet that's how life continues on,
the record continues to play. Isn't that how this life works? I'm not sure. Maybe
life comes in different flavors. Maybe it comes in one flavor. We are all inhabitants
of a life upon which we are vicims. There might be no other answer to any of it, yet
here we are.
