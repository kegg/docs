Today is a mixture of feelings and thoughts. Not sure what to think about any of it
all. So I'm just here doing my thing hoping it will all get better. Isn't that the
way it's meant to be? Who knows.

There can only be so many things a person can go through in a lifetime isn't there?
Or do they just have to keep on going until they hit a breaking point? Breaking
points are not an easy thing to come across. They don't always make sense, and they
just don't seem to be worth it.

There are days where you just want to crawl into a ball and fall asleep. Perhaps a
coma would be nice? I'm not sure. There would be nice things for it all, but honestly
who knows.
