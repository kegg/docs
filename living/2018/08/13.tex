The more I read about history of the LDS Church, the more upset I become. Is it wrong
to have these thoughts and feelings? I do not know. I cannot understand how there can
only be one true church because God says that's the way it is. Whatever happened to
just trying your best? Living the laws God provided thorugh his son Jesus Christ?
Whatever happened to love the lord thy God and your neighbor? Now there are so many
other things members of the church have to obey in order to be in good standing. It
doesn't add up to me.

Then there are those who would tell you to have faith in things which you cannot
handle at this current moment in time. That kind of blind faith is just not what I
have in mind when I want to know things. Granted, there are some things which can
wait. There are some things I do not need to know the answer to. I'm fine with that.
But then there are historical things which I simply cannot let rest without knowing
the answer to them.

Does that make sense? I'm not sure it does. It's a bit of a jumble inside my brain
somedays.
