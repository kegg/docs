Today is another day. The weekend is just about here. A three day weekend which is
nice. Talk about an adventure. Well, maybe not an adventure. Adventures don't always
last, they tend to be around and whatnot, but they don't always last. Everything
always comes to an end no matter what you wish to believe will happen. That's okay
for it to do, I mean it's meant to happen that way isn't it? Yeah, something like
that.

For trying to protect children in the LDS church, the man behind the effort is being
faced with possible excommunication. Now tell me, where is that even remotely fair?
He raised awareness of things happening within the Mormon church and is being
punished because of it. It doesn't feel right that they should do this to him. It's
not right. It's not fair.
