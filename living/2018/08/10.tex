Another day to see the world. Yet here we sit waiting for something to take place and
it will never happen. Seeing the world isn't always a must thing to do, but it can
be. Okay that didn't make sense. It's a thing you want to do, it's a wish. Everyone
has a wish at times. Not everyone can fulfill their wishes though, and that's a
shame. I suppose that's why they call them dreams. A person can dream, but that deam
might never come true. A shame.

Feelings come and go at times. Sometimes feelings are meant to be there other times
they're not. There are so many different feelings which come to a person, and so many
distractions in a day, a moment, a week, a year. Everything comes down to nothing. Is
there ever a time in life when everything makes perfect sense? I would say no.
Nothing has ever made 100\% sense to anyone. That is the way of life. We are meant to
be in the dark about some things. If everything made sense, we wouldn't be able to
learn and grow I suppose.
