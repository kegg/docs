This week will feel like Hell.

Why do I feel this way? I'm not sure. I just have a feeling. Woke up with a panic
attack this morning. That's never a good sign for any week whatsoever. But I came
into work. Almost stayed home, but no I can't do that. A panic attack doesn't equate
to being sick. Anxiety runs in me. Fine. It's a fact. I cannot allow it to define who
I am.
