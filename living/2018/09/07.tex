Today has been a crazy odd day. Been forgetting things left and right today. At least
six things I've forgotten. Crazy!

Shall we name them? Sure! Why not!

\begin{enumerate}
\item I forgot my Oreos
\item I forgot my Halloween snow globes I bought
\item I forgot my sandwhich making supplies for lunch
\item I forgot my coke
\item I forgot my McCafe mocha I got from the store
\item I forgot I told my coworker all of this and then told him again
\end{enumerate}

I'm gonna hit my head against a desk now. Don't look, it won't be pretty.
