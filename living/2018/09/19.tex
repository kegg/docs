Today feels off, I can't put my finger on it. It doesn't make any sense and yet here
I am wondering what is so wrong about it. Talk about a crazy day indeed. I'm sure it
will eventually make some kind of sense maybe? I'm not sure. I just want it to get
better whatever is going on in my brain, I wish I knew better.
