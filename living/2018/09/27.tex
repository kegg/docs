What's in a day exactly? Here we are wondering about everything under the sun, and
yet we do not fully understand anything that goes on. It is a life which we live and
a life which we do not have a complete knowledge about. What is to be done with that?
I do not know. I wish I had an idea of what it is all about, but I simply do not have
any kind of idea. Perhaps it is meant to be this way. We are simply not meant to
grasp fully anything in this life until the very end, at which point we will still be
learning about it all? Who's to say. It is but a mystery that I cannot fathom at the
moment.
