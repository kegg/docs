Been working on some things as of late. Nothing too
important mind you. Just some interesting things. There's
a section of the LDS Narrative which isn't in use anymore.
It's called the Journal of Discourses. The LDS Church no
longer confirms these as valid resources. So I started to
compile places where they've been used.

It was quite boring actually. But when the church controls
the narrative, they decide what is used and what isn't used as
can be expected. So yeah, it got boring. \ref{fig:jod} Shows
what they look like.
