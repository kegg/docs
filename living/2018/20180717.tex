There comes a time in life... many times in a life where one simply does not
know where to go or what to do. They do not understand pretty much anything
which is tossed about around them. The person, themselves, can feel quite lost
during these times. There's nothing wrong with such feelings. Teachings of the
past flood their mind, they do not understand or know what is going on. Being
confused about it all hurts. It's one thing to have a belief system, but when
that belief system comes crashing down around you where does that leave you?

To go back to the days where you believed so innocently. There are times when
that would be nice. But they aren't always possible. So many thoughts come and
go in and out of the mind at times. It can be overwhelming, and even then that's
just being nice.

So, what does one do about it? Do they keep marching on as if nothing has taken
place? Do they confront the issue at hand? What are they to do about any of it?
So many questions with so many uncertainties and unanswered everything. Talk
about a rollercoaster. I wish at times I had never embarked on this journey, but
now I know what I know. There's no turning back.
