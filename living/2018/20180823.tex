\section{Thu, Aug 23, 2018}\footnote{Day 4}

Thursday, what is there to say about a Thursday? I mean it's close to a Friday and we
are here and that's all which matters right? Yes, something like that. But there are
other things in this life which make less sense than anything else. This life is not
meant as a throwaway possiblity. An attempt to simply live and see what happens. We
are to have a purpose for being here. I believe that purpose is for people to treat
each other with kindness. There's nothing wrong with spreading kindness throughout
the world to other people. I imagine that's what God intends for us all to be chiefly
concerned about. Not how much money we can make, but how we live and treat others.
