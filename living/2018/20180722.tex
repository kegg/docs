So many confusing aspects of life come about because people don't grasp their own
history. When people do try and attempt to understand that history, they are called
unto repentence because it's showing negative light upon the church. A church which
doesn't want its history to be made and known public doesn't have a leg to stand on.

\st{So many confusing...} There are really things out there which don't make sense.
It would be nice if they actually did make sense for once. But they do not and so we
are left with our own thoughts and processes upon which we are meant to try and
understand that which we cannot. Some would tell you to simply wait until things get
better, until a time when we are able to understand all of it, we are meant to have
faith and act accordingly.

What if I don't want to waste my time?

It never ceases to amaze me, when something bad happens in a person's life they think
it's a sign from God. That there's some reason they're having this difficulty and
it's a blessing that they are going through such an experience.

That's not always the case.

Sometimes bad things just ... happen. Bad things happen to good people, they happen
to bad people. Bad things really just happen. There's no reason to expect it's a sign
from God or that God is putting you through a trial for a specific reason. I wish
people would accept and understand that better. But they don't.
