A weekend is here. What more is there to say about it than that? I do not dare
say, for I do not know. It is what it is. Is that not enough thinking for one
day? Perhaps it is. Yes, today is but a day. Another day to try and grasp that
which is meant to be understood and grasped. Something else which is meant to be
looked at, a feat within itself. Nothing else can matter at this point, for it
is but a day. How's that for repetition? Yeah, I thought it was rather annoying
as well.

To be honest, some people tend to repeat themselves. I've been known to do it.
It wasn't right at all. Such thinking can be bad I believe. But that is a
personal belief. To keep thinking the same things over again, is to keep telling
yourself one thing when you know and trust in something completely different.

Is that how this life is meant to work? I do not know.

So many people have questions in this life. Not all questions can be answered by
a simple flick of the switch. Not every question can be answered, period. There
are questions which people have, valid questions. They are looking for answers
to those questions. When they ask their questions, they desire answers. Those
answers do not come. They become frustrated. It's a valid response. If you're
constantly told not to worry about a thing, and to simply let it go. That's
where the dangers rise up. People will seek out their answers. Sometimes they
will leave a place to go and find them. That is how life is.
