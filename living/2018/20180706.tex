A weekend is here. What more is there to say about it than that? I do not dare
say, for I do not know. It is what it is. Is that not enough thinking for one
day? Perhaps it is. Yes, today is but a day. Another day to try and grasp that
which is meant to be understood and grasped. Something else which is meant to be
looked at, a feat within itself. Nothing else can matter at this point, for it
is but a day. How's that for repetition? Yeah, I thought it was rather annoying
as well.

To be honest, some people tend to repeat themselves. I've been known to do it.
It wasn't right at all. Such thinking can be bad I believe. But that is a
personal belief. To keep thinking the same things over again, is to keep telling
yourself one thing when you know and trust in something completely different.

Is that how this life is meant to work? I do not know.
