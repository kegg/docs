The more I read about history of the LDS Church, the more upset I become. Is it wrong
to have these thoughts and feelings? I do not know. I cannot understand how there can
only be one true church because God says that's the way it is. Whatever happened to
just trying your best? Living the laws God provided thorugh his son Jesus Christ?
Whatever happened to love the lord thy God and your neighbor? Now there are so many
other things members of the church have to obey in order to be in good standing. It
doesn't add up to me.
