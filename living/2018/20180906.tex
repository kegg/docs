Found an interesting thing today. Not sure if I've ever figured this one out or not
before?

The below will not compile.

\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{2018/TestCase.java}

It throws the following error:

\begin{displayquote}
TestCase.java:14: error: variable found is already defined in method main(String[])
        boolean found = true;
\end{displayquote}

So variables within case statements carry onward thorugh the switch. Interesting
indeed.
