Cars on the freeway. That's what life feels like at times. Just a bunch of cars on a
freeway. There's nothing wrong with cars on a freeway mind you. Until they end up
getting into an accident, or backing up the freeway so you cannot move forward.
Obviously you can't go backwards either. But you sure as hell can't move forward.
That's what this life is about. Always  moving forward, sometimes you are stuck in a
section for a while. That would be where the freeway is stopped. But other times you
are inching forward towards whatever goal you have. It's not always a fast
progression either. When the freeway is moving fast, that's a good sign.
