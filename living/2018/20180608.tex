40 Years ago today. The Priesthood and Temple Ban on the Negro race was lifted.

There is in this life truths which cannot be denied. There are times when men
speak for God without asking God if they should say such things. It can be
rather embarrassing later on down the road when they have to change their speak,
claiming it to be from God or that God never instructed them to say such things.

As a body, we are expected to listen to their explaination of it all and simply
accept it. Moving forward as though none of it ever happened. This is not how
life works though. It is not in human nature to simply forget something happened
when in fact it did. There is no denying what was taught.

Yes we can move forward from such an act. But we cannot forget what happened in
order to not repeat the past. I hope that makes some kind of sense. It is better
to move forward into the future without repeating past mistakes than it is to
create those mistakes all oever again.

Naturally it is better to have not made such foolish statements to begin with,
but I fear that is human nature. I would say more on this topic, but I fear I
might get too heated. I do not wish that.\footnote{I of course am speaking about
blacks finally receiving the blessings of the priesthood and the temple after
so many years of prophets and aposltes having anti feelings towards them as a 
race. In my opinion, it should never have happened. They should have always
had the blessings allowed them, because God is not that author of confusion,
and God is not a respector of men.}
