There is in this life, the thinking that a person can get away with anything. It is
not the correct thinking on anything, but it is a thought some people have. To say
anyone can get away with anything is a falsehood. The law will always catch up with
that person. This will always be the case. If for some reason the law does not catch
up with them in this life, the eternal law and judgement will catch up with them in
the life to come. So yes, the law will always catch up with them.
