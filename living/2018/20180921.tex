Today is but a day. We live in a day where no good deed goes unpunished. If there
were but a reason which we might be able to understand or grasp, we might be able to
fully understand everything which is able to come our way. If we do not understand or
grasp that which is to come our way, then we are but a civilizations waiting for
destruction. We must stand up to those things which are meant to be and we are in
need to be able to do away with those things unnecessary.

Be strong.

Do what you need to be able to do to stand up and be counted for that which is right
and good.
