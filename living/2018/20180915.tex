Today is another day. That's all there is to it. The inward feelings and thoughts
which come across, they aren't the easiest or best thoughts ever. So here we sit
waiting for something better to come along. Will anything better ever come along? I
do not know. It would be nice for something nice to be able to sit and simply wait
for it to happen. Yet, here I am still waiting for closure. What is it I'm waiting
closure on? Well, that's a long story. Maybe I will say why someday, but now? No. It
can't happen and it won't happen anytime soon. So that's all there is to it.

Writing things down has a way of calming you. Be it handwriting, or electronically.
Either way? I feel handwriting has the ability to help out the most. When you can sit
down and write \st{some} experiences out on paper? It's a great feeling. It feels
right and has a way of calming you down. Talk about a breath of relief.
