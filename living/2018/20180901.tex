There needs to be some kind of awareness made, beyond a shadow of a doubt regarding
things that are happening within oranizations. Organizations go about doing as they
please without checks and balances, except to their own higher ups. The LDS Church or
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is one such organization. I do not know
how long I can be silent on such matters myself. Parents have said no, don't do it
don't go against the teachings of the church etc. Well I do not believe I would be
going against the church's teachings. Children have got to be protected. There is
nothing else to be said about it. Is that not what God had in mind when Jesus said to
protect these little ones?

Life tends to come at us quickly. Faster than we'd like or enjoy. But we are able to
grab hold of whatever we need in order to make it through whatever we are coming
across as a challenge. That's the way God created us. We have the ability within
ourselves to overcome whatever obstacle has come about.
