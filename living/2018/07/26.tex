Today is but a day. Tomorrow is but another day. We are living in the here and now
and that is all which  matters. There is no time like the present, that's a saying
which has been said here and there. If you do not look forward to that which you are
given today, there is no hope for tomorrow. All things which might have been said of
people in the past, I do not know if they have or not. If they haven't, then they
should have been said.

This life is here for us to enjoy it. To be understanding of anything which comes
into our own minds and heart as truth. We are to seek out the truth and understand as
best as we can the teachings from it. There is nothing wrong with that thought.
Knowledge is a good thing, it is God given and it is here for us to grasp and take
with us on this journey throughout life.
