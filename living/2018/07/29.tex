Why are so many things annoying in life? There should be something done about the
annoying things. I'm not sure what should be done about it all? But well, soemthing.
Anything would be nice. Yes, that would be perfect. Yet here we are simply having to
accept the annoying things which go on and there's nothing we are able to do about
any of it.

So what then? What happens next? Are we meant to just sit here and allow things to
happen? We have the ability to attempt to stop things, this is true. But how many
people actually step up and try to stop it? Any of it?
