Today is but a day, tomorrow is another day which will eventually turn into
dust. Nothing will ever last. It all goes downhill and gets destroyed. There is
nothing wrong with such a thought for that is how the universe will continue to
spin and go around in circles. Yet it is today.\footnote{
We can see at this point in the trials of the author, they are starting to lose
their mind. They cannot confirm or deny this of course, but their words tend to
continue to loop around that which they no longer comprehend. Is it actually a
life story or is it a work of art, a work of fiction.

I would like to think for a moment that this life exists for a reason. Beyond
anything that religious beliefs have brought about and taught. It is here for a
reason, a good reason? Maybe. Some kind of reason to be sure of. If that is not
the case then this life is lived in vain and everything else which belongs to it
can and must be destroyed along with everything else.
