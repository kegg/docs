Friday has come upon us. This is amazing. I love a good Friday actually. There's not
reason not to enjoy a Friday. It's just the last hurrah before the weekend comes
along. Three day weekend here for me due to personal issues and problems. That's okay
though.

Ever sit back and think and wonder to yourself, what on Earth am I doing here? In the
circumstances I was placed into? The people I live with. All of those things which
come and go into the thoughts of people? Yeah something like that. It comes and goes
and here we all are, just trying to live life to the best of our ability I suppose. I
mean, come on though. There has got to be someting better. Something out there which
doesn't seem to matter about anything but happiness that we are to be experiencing.

But then you read the newspaper and learn about all of the evil things out there in
the world. You just have to wonder. What the heck is going on in the minds of some of
these people? They can't be for real, can they? I'm just not sure.

Who is to say exactly how this life is meant to unfold? I do not think there is any
kind of reason for any of it. We are here. We go through this life. We die. Is that
not enough of an explaination?
