Ah, another day. Is there much to be said beyond that? I doubt it. It is another day
however, and so here we are. We are meant to understand things which cannot be
understood right now. As an example, be ye therefore perfect even as God is
perfect.\footnote{Matthew 5:48} We are to understand this as, strive to be perfect
but know that you will fall. That's why Christ suffered for our sins. So when we do
fall short of perfection, we are able to rise up and try to be better than we are. Be
better today than you were yesterday and so on.

It's okay not to be perfect right now. It's also okay to try your best. I'd say it's
even asked that we try our best no matter what happens. If we try our best, we can
overcome things that easily befall us. No one is perfect. That's just the way life
happens. No one is perfect at all. If we were perfect, we wouldn't be here.
