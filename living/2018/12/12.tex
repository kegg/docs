Don't feel that great today. Nose is stuffy. Tired as all get out. It's gonna be one
of those days I think. It's supposed to snow. That's a plus. We need all the water we
can get from when it melts. So that can be a good thing for sure.

Ever wonder about something, and then you just can't shake that feeling? Yeah...
that's where I'm at a lot these days. It would be nice to be able to figure out
everything in the world and just not have to deal with things that I can't figure
out. I suppose those things I have no control over and should just let them be.
Whatever the case, I guess that's not important.

So here I am. Simply trying to make it through another day.
