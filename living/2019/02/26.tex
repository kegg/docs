Today is but another day. I cann deal with that. There's nothing
wrong with any of that thinking. Life comes and goes as we want
it to. It doesn't always have the opportunity to do as we wish,
that much is certain. But we are here...is that not enough?

There are times in life which don't always make sense, that's what
happens I suppose. A lot of it has to do with religion. People say this,
people say that. People all over the world believe different things even
within the same community they believe different things. Not everyone has
the same thought process as others...is that an okay thing to do? I'm
not one to judge anything, for it is not my place to judge.

Life occurs beyond reasons we are able to understand. I suppose I can
live with that thought process...maybe. I mean, who is to have a full
understanding of everything? I don't think anyone mortal can have such
a knowledge.

We have the gospel of Jesus Christ found in the Bible. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4.
Have a look at that. It states right there he suffered for sins, died, and 
rose on the third day.

It's there in plain sight. There's nothing wrong with this knowledge. It
is truth, it is life. A life upon which Christ would have us build.
