Life is bleh at the moment. That's really all it can be explained as. Bills pile 
up and then they go away just to have more bills pile up later on. If that's how 
life works? I just don't know. But there's always something more to this life 
then there was right? Yeah something like that. Who knows. Life will continue 
forward and we'll just keep on moving on until something else happens.

How can there be so many sources for the gospel of Christ when they differ from 
each other? Which is correct? The Jesus of the Bible? The Jesus of the Book of 
Mormon? The Jesus of the Doctrine and Covenants? Which is the correct one to 
follow?

One teaches grace, one teaches works where you suffer until you've paid for your 
own sins after all you've done (if you've not lived the commandments). No matter 
what happens, we will all fall short of the glory of God. That's basically 
guaranteed. If that were not the case, a Savior wouldn't have been needed.
