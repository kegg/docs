Life is bleh at the moment. That's really all it can be explained as. Bills pile 
up and then they go away just to have more bills pile up later on. If that's how 
life works? I just don't know. But there's always something more to this life 
then there was right? Yeah something like that. Who knows. Life will continue 
forward and we'll just keep on moving on until something else happens.
