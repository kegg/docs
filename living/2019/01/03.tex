I just sat down and blinded myself. Now that's awesome. There's sunlight coming
through the window next to me. It's blinding I tell you! Blinding! Oh well, that's wh
at happens when the sunlight comes through the windows isn't it. I dare say it is
quite annoying, but what can you do about it? Nothing.

Life has the ability to mess with you. You don't know it's messing with you, but you
have to realize it at some point...there's just no going back. I would guess it's
something you don't have control over. That's simply life.\footnote{I do wonder at 
times what would happen if we had full control over whatever we came across in this
life. Would we make the same choices we currently make? Would we be different? How
would all of that end up? What would that kind of reality look like?}
