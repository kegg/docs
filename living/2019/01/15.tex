There are some days where you don't want it to end...you wish it to continue onward
no matter what. Then there are days where you don't know how to exist. It all becomes
a matter of words which consume you. That's okay though, this life is simply an
extension of how a life is meant to be lived. If you understand that phrase, tell me
because I don't have a clue.
