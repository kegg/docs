If we are but to exist, what is the point of it all? There has to be something more
to this life than simply existing. Why can't we simply look out to the future and see
what's meant to take place? Why can't we understand everything at once? I suppose
life would be a bit weird if that were the case...but well, what can you do about it?

If there is something more to this life than what we have accessable to our
fingertips at the moment, eventually we'll come across that right? One would hope so.
At least, I would hope so.
