\section{Wed, Jan 2, 2019}

Tis but another day, of a new year perhaps but another day indeed.

It would be nice to understand the difficulties that come with the day, but here we
are unable to fully grasp or understand what is going on. It is a day like no other,
and we are merely puppets on a stage as it were.

With the new year at our beck and call...or are we at its beck and call? I do not
know. Whatever happens this year happens. Is that not enough of an answer for it?
