There are so many questions that occur in this life. Why can't we always have the 
right answer to it all? Doesn't make sense does it? No, not really. Yet here
we are. We should find a way to simply understand something easier. Perhaps there
is another answer to this life. If there is? It should be an understanding. People
need to understand and be able to grasp what is to be understood. Does that make
any sense? I doubt it. It would be nice if it did have a way to make sense.
