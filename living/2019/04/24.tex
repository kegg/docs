There's a problem with not believing anymore. When you say you don't believe, 
your friends and family leave you. It's that simple. People don't believe that 
happens, but it does. Because there have been countless leaders telling those 
who no longer believe to keep those people at arms length. It doesn't seem very 
Christlike. Christ went to those people who would seperate themselves from an 
organization. He went to the one lost sheep and brought them back to him. Not to 
an organization. The church in Christ's time was the furthest from the truth. He 
didn't bring people to the church, He brought people to believe in Him. See the 
difference? Not many people do.
