The more you learn about certain things, the more you simply want to hide away 
and not look at them again. Is that a bad thing to suppose? Is that a bad thing 
to think about? I'm not sure. This life comes at us with so many difference of 
opinions and we simply don't have all the answers. We sometimes wish we did, but 
we don't. If that's something to be ashamed of? Well, then let us be ashamed.

It's okay to say you don't have all of the answers necessary for some task. It's 
okay to say you need help to understand something. Reminding the mind that 
that's the case? Oh that's something completely different.
