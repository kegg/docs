\chapter{Others Teachings}

There are teachings from others in Joseph Smith's time that are similar to
those found in the Book of Mormon. Did Joseph Smith take these from local
preachers and teachings found in his time?

Take for example the teaching that this life is a probationary period. Abel 
Thornton taught similar ideas.

\begin{displayquote}
That the whole period of human life is a state of probation; in every part of 
which a sinner may repent and turn to God; and in every part of it a believer 
may give way to sin and fall from grace: and that this possibility of rising, 
and liability to falling, are essential to a state of trial or 
probation.\footnote{The life of Elder Abel Thornton, late of Johnston, R.I. 
A preacher in the Free-Will Baptist Connexion, and a member of the R.I.Q. meeting}
