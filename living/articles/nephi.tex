\section{Nephi or Moroni}

Another interesting fact that came up in early church history was the account of
Joseph Smith speaking to the prophet Nephi. Yes, Nephi. He originally said it
was Nephi who had visited him, not the angel Moroni. We can find this in the
Joseph Smith Papers:

\begin{displayquote}
The room was exceedingly light but not so much so as immediately around his 
person When I first looked upon <​him​> it I was afraid; but the fear soon left 
me: calling me by name, <he> said. that he was a messenger. sent from the 
presence of God to me. and that his name was Nephi.\footnote{

}
\end{displayquote}

This was even publisehd in the Pearl of Great Price. It was later changed to
Moroni having visited Joseph Smith in what is the most current version of the
Pearl of Great Price.

Why the change? Why did Joseph change who had visited him? Who was it? Was it
Nephi or Moroni? If they both visited him, it was at different times. But the
narrative was changed to reflect that it was Moroni...after first being Nephi.
The experience, that one night, was changed. Why?
