\section{Appendix C: An Address to All Believers in Christ}

Joseph looked into the hat in which he placed the stone, and received a 
revelation that some of the brethren should go to Toronto, Canada, and that 
they would sell the copyright of the Book of Mormon. Hiram Page and Oliver 
Cowdery went to Toronto on this mission, but they failed entirely to sell the 
copyright, returning without any money. Joseph was at my father's house when 
they returned. I was there also, and am an eye witness to these facts. Jacob 
Whitmer and John Whitmer were also present when Hiram Page and Oliver Cowdery 
returned from Canada. Well, we were all in great trouble; and we asked Joseph 
how it was that he had received a revelation from the Lord for some brethren to 
go to Toronto and sell the copyright, and the brethren had utterly failed in 
their undertaking. Joseph did not know how it was, so he enquired of the Lord 
about it, and behold the following revelation came through the stone: 
`Some revelations are of God: some revelations are of men: and some 
revelations are of the devil.' So we see that the revelation to go to 
Toronto and sell the copyright was not of God, but was of the devil 
or of the heart of man.
