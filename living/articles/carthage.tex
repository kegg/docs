\section{Carthage Jail}

Joseph was arrested for civil disturbance. Well he went to answer charges
because of it. But he states the following:
\begin{displayquote}
I know not why; but for some reason I am constrained to hasten my  preparations, 
and to confer upon the Twelve all the ordinances, keys,  covenants, endowments, 
and sealing ordinances of the priesthood, and so  set before them a pattern in 
all things pertaining to the sanctuary and  the endowment therein. (Quoted by 
Parley P. Pratt in "Proclamation to  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints," Millennial Star, Mar. 1845, 151.)\footnote{

}
\end{displayquote}

If he wouldn't have passed on those keys etc to the 12, they wouldn't still be 
around. Would he have died at Carthage or would he have escaped that situation? 
Because God wouldn't have a 2nd "apostasy", would he?
