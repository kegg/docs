\chapter{Book of Mormon Translation}

For years members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were told that
Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon. It is said he translated it by the ``gift
and power of God." When people think of translation, they think he looked at the
plates and translated letter for letter, word for word the words of ancient prophets.

This was not the case. Joseph would place a seer stone in a hat, and put his face
into the hat. He would then read off the words as they appeared to him. The words on
the stone wouldn't change until his scribe confirmed back to him what was said.

The actual gold plates weren't used in the translation process at all.

People have brought up the question about how Bible passages, complete with changes
known to have been made by men, made it into the Book of Mormon. We have a possible
explaination for that. Joseph Smith copied the passages from the Bible into the 
Book of Mormon:

\begin{displayquote}
When Joseph Smith saw that the Nephite record was quoting the prophecies of Isaiah, 
of Malachi, and the words of the Savior, he took the English Bible and compared these 
passages as far as they paralleled each other, and finding that in substance in 
thought, they were alike, he adopted our English 
translation.\footnote{Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations Manual, pp.
505-506, 1903-1904. New Witnesses for God. Volume II. The Book of Mormon Part I.

\end{displayquote}

So we're not even sure we have those passages copied word for word from the gold
plates. If that's the case? How are we to be sure that the rest of the book is really
the ``most correct book" out of them all?

There have been noted changes in the book throughout its history. The Eternal Father
being changed to Son of The Eternal Father for Christ etc. It seems to point towards
Joseph changing the words of the prophets. The idea of one god to three seperate
individuals.

But whenever someone questions the validity of the book, they are told to pray about
it. Taking Moroni's promise and seeing for themselves if it is true. Again, acting on
feelings alone and not evidence.

We were taught from the beginning, that the Book of Mormon is about the Native
Americans who came from Jerusalem. That is they were Jews. Science has determined
this not to be the case. The church had to make a change in the introduction of the
Book of Mormon, where it once said the Lamenite people ``are the principal ancestors 
of the American Indians", now it reads ``are among the ancestors of the American 
Indians."

If that change had to be made, what else about the book has been deemed wrong or
incorrect?

Some have come to believe that Joesph made the whole book up, that it was his
imagination which caused the Book of Mormon to come about. They claim the book is not
a historical document, but people should look on the principles taught within the
book which is more important than the origins.

The Book of Mormon stands as a keystone to the LDS Religion. If it is a fraud, then
the whole church is a fraud and Joseph Smith was not a prophet of God. Church leaders
have stated thusly, challenging those who would criticize the book.

President Gordon B. Hinckley had the following things to say:

\begin{displayquote}
There is no middle ground. Joseph Smith talked with the Father and the Son or 
he didn’t. If he didn’t, then we are embraced in a great fraud, a terrible 
fraud.\footnote{``Counsel from the Prophet," Church News, 4/27/96, 4}
\end{displayquote}

\begin{displayquote}
Our whole strength rests on the validity of that vision. It either occurred or 
it did not occur. If it did not, then this work is a fraud… upon that unique and 
wonderful experience stands the validity of this church.\footnote{
``The Marvelous Foundation of our Faith," Ensign [Conference Edition], 
November 2002, 80
}
\end{displayquote}

\begin{displayquote}
You and I are faced with the stark question of accepting the truth of the First 
Vision and that which followed it. On the question of its reality lies the very 
validity of this Church.\footnote{“The Stone Cut Out of the Mountain,” Ensign 
[Conference Edition], November 2007, 86}
\end{displayquote}

\begin{displayquote}
That becomes the hinge pin on which this whole cause turns. If the First Vision 
was true, if it actually happened, then the Book of Mormon is true. Then we have 
the priesthood. Then we have the Church organization and all of the other keys 
and blessings of authority which we say we have. If the First Vision did not 
occur, then we are involved in a great sham. It is just that 
simple.\footnote{Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley, 227}
\end{displayquote}

The book itself states that if there are mistakes in it, those are the mistakes of
men (possibly the translation) and not of God.\footnote{Book of Mormon Title Page}

Why was the manner of translating the book never taught in a primary or sunday school
class? Why did it have to come out through other means? Those teachings were thought
to be anti-mormon lies and false doctrine, only to be proven later on they were true.
