\section{Doctrine of Christ}

We are told in the Book of Mormon that the Doctrine of Christ is fourfold:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Faith
  \item Repentance
  \item Baptism
  \item Receive the Holy Ghost
\end{enumerate}

This is found in 2nd Nephi 31-32, there it states the Doctrine of Christ and the
results of receiving the Doctrine of Christ. Covenants with established blessings
attached to them.

The Book of Mormon then reiterates it in 3rd Nephi chapter 11. Again it establishes
Christ's Doctrine. We are to be baptized in Christ's name. But near the end of the
chapter, it says that ``whoso shall declare more or less than this, and establish it
for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil, and is not built upon my rock."\footnote{
3 Nephi 11:40
} It goes on to say how the person will be thrust down to hell etc.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints declares its doctrine to be more than
that which Christ has spoken, how does the church get around it? What are their
explainations for adding to the doctrine of Jesus Christ?

I find it troubling the churche's own scripture even says not to add to it, and yet
they have. I suppose one could argue the church isn't adding to the Doctrine of
Christ, but adding to the doctrine as a whole. The doctrine of Christ remains
untouched. But is not Christ the church and that doctrine would be the same?

To me, these scriptures teach that we are to repent of our sins, be baptized and
become like a little child. We are then able to inherit the kingdom of God. It
doesn't say anything about having to go to the temple, pay tithing etc. Those things
are not requirements to be with God. Yet the church claims those are requirements,
that one cannot dwell with God without having all of those necessary ordinances done.

Are not those other ordinances additions to the Doctrine of Christ? The same thing
which Jesus had warned against having additions to?
