\chapter{What's In A Name}

\begin{displayquote}
Members `offend' Jesus and please the devil when they use the term `Mormon,' 
President Nelson says\footnote{Salt Lake Tribune Article Title}
\end{displayquote}

According to President Nelson, the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints:

\begin{displayquote}
Using common nicknames such as ``Mormon church," ``LDS Church" or the 
``Church of the Latter-day Saints," Nelson said, ``... is a major victory for
Satan."\footnote{Salt Lake Tribune Article}
\end{displayquote}

So God waited 188 years to clarify the name of His church when it wasn't being said
correctly even back in Joseph Smith's day? People were being called Mormon's for a
long time. President Nelson isn't new to this way of thinking, he gave a talk in 1990
titled ``Thus Shall My Church Be Called". Six months later, he was called out by
Gordon B. Hinckley in a talk titled ``Mormon Should Mean `More Good'". Hinckley said
that the name Mormon is fine.

So have we been led astray by these prophets, seers, and revelators all of these
years? Remember when President Ezra Taft Benson sang ``I'm a Mormon Boy" in General
Conference? Was he worshipping Satan? That's one of my most favorite memories of him
and now I am expected to think he was upsetting Jesus and God.
