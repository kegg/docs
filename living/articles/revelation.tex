\chapter{Revelation}

We live in a time of continuous revelation as it were. When the church was
being organized and during the time Joseph Smith was the prophet of the church,
he continued to receive revelations. The Doctrine and Covenants of the church
is full of revelations.

After Joseph's death, there doesn't appear to be many revelations coming forth
from the church. Some point to the end of polygamy, or the end of the ban 
against the blacks. There are those also who say there were other reasons
to end those things.

From a publication by David Whitmer, we find the following quote:

\begin{displayquote}
Some revelations are of God: 
some revelations are of man: 
and some revelations are of the devil.\footnote{David Whitmer, 
An Address to All Believers in Christ, in EMD 5: 198.}
\end{displayquote}

This is in regards to the failiure of the church to sell the copyright in
Canada. (See Appendix C: An Address to All Believers in Christ)

Ahem, say what now? Revelations coming from the devil? As revelation? What?

How is that possible? It's been said that the devil can show himself as an 
angel, but an entire revelation from the devil? Wow, what kind of hot water
must you be in to get one of those?

Either way? How does one know if the revelation is from man, God, or the devil?
In what ways are we supposed to actually fully know that these things are
true and to do as they direct, or if we are to set them aside for they are evil?

Makes things rather complicated right?

After Joseph Smith's death, there weren't many additions to the Doctrine and
Covenants. No new revelations added. The Official Declarations 1 and 2 don't
appear to be revelations as they do not say ``Thus saith the Lord" in them,
which was known to be had in other revelations throughout the book.

So what are they exactly?

There's a revelation by Joseph F. Smith which became section 138 of the D\&C,
but nothing since then. Why is that? If we are a church that believes in
continuous revelations, why is that book not being updated? Why are there
not more revelations coming and recored?

Time has changed things. Are people not as revelatory since the times of
Joseph Smith, Jr. when he led the church? Do we have all we need and God doesn't
see fit to speak to us in this day and age?

You might be thinking I'm being rude. But these are honest questions. I'm not
bashing the prophets who have come since Joseph Smith, Jr. I am just not aware
of actual revelations which have come along the way is all.
