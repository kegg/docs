\chapter{Condemnation}

The Book of Mormon was published in 1830. Exact date was 26 March 1830.\footnote{
Larry C. Porter, "From a Book Coming Forth," Ensign (July 1988), 42.} Though there
were parts of the book published in a newspaper in January of that same year.

However, 2 years later in September 1832 Joseph Smith received a revelation that the
church was under condemantion for forgetting the ``new covenant, even the Book of
Mormon." Two years? That seems pretty quick to place an entire church under
condemnation for not following scripture.

Here's the scripture in full:

\begin{displayquote}
And your minds in times past have been darkened because of unbelief, and because you 
have treated lightly the things you have receivedâ€”

Which vanity and unbelief have brought the whole church under condemnation.

And this condemnation resteth upon the children of Zion, even all.

And they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new 
covenant, even the Book of Mormon and the former commandments which I have given 
them, not only to say, but to do according to that which I have written.\footnote{
D\&C 84:54-57
