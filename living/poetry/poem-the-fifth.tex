\poemtitle{A Belief In What}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Than Tycho Brahe, or Erra Pater:}
\begin{verse}
\poemlines{2}
Such a day \\
a belief we grasp \\
something unique \\
or without a wand \\!

There is a time \\
appointed for all \\
to understand something \\
everything or nothing \\!

Life is infinite \\
at least that's what they say \\
there could be something \\
to come along the way \\!

So life up your voice \\
and be of good cheer \\
waiting for the end \\
to come without fear \\!

What is belief \\
if not a standard for some \\
yet it's not always true \\
or understandable \\!

Life comes along \\
we do not know when \\
it will come crashing down \\
yet a belief exists \\!
\end{verse}
