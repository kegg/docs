\settowidth{\versewidth}{Than Tycho Brahe, or Erra Pater:}
\begin{verse}
\poemlines{2}
It is but a day \\
to behold and the like \\
yet here we are \\
not understanding each other \\!

Here we are \\
staring across a room \\
a vast ocean as it were \\
and yet we don't know \\!

Who is to know \\
or understand \\
that which is meant \\
to be? \\!
\end{verse}
