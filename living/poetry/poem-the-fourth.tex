\begin{verse}
\poemlines{2}
Oh to be human\\
it is but a dream\\
wondering back and forth\\
on some light beam\\!

We do not understand\\
or fully can grasp\\
all that is happening\\
until the very last\\!

Some say this life\\
is but a curse\\
perhaps it would be better\\
if we had knowledge first\\!

So we hem and we haw\\
over land and the sea\\
wondering and waiting\\
oh what must this be?\\!

A life without end\\
or beginning it seems\\
we hope for a freedom\\
how brightly it gleams\\!

Waiting for a wonderful day\\
of bright sunshine and joy\\
don't be caught looking\\
down at a fake ploy\\!
\end{verse}
