\begin{verse}
\poemlines{2}
What is this life\\
upon which we live!\\
a meaningless chore\\
oh what a bore\\!

If I had a dream\\
to understand all\\
a place to grasp\\
maybe stand tall\\!

I'd go about\\
all of the land\\
the sea as it were\\
and preach of this life\\!

Yet here we are\\
learning afar\\
from heaven above\\
that romaing star\\!

We shouldn't grasp\\
for things not unseen\\
or fully misunderstood\\
but we sure can dream\\!
\end{verse}
