\poemtitle{But A Man}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Than Tycho Brahe, or Erra Pater:}
\begin{verse}
\poemlines{2}
There was a man \\
destined to something great \\
a challenge to himself \\
and yet he was afraid \\!

He didn't allow \\
such fear to stop him \\
for it could do nothing \\
but cause him to run \\!

So he continued on \\
a path he felt was right \\
something within him burned \\
and that man made something of himself \\!

To be afriad \\
is to destroy your innermost self \\
long before it has time \\
to incubate \\!
\end{verse}
