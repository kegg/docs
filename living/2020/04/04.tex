It is but another day. Not sure what to say about that, just that it's another day.
There should be something to be said about all of that, but I don't suppose there
is really.

It's General Conference today and tomorrow. Should prove to be interesting. There's
not much else to do but watch \st{tune into} those and see what's to be said.
