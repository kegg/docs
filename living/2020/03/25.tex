There are days that feel so much easier. Yet here we are waiting for something
to happen. Some good thing to take place. We don't know where any of it is 
going, but we do know that it won't be going anywhere fast unless we step up
and take charge.

It is interesting that there are those who will not step up and take a chance. 
They either cannot or will not step into the darkness which is out there. For
once you take a step into the darkness, the light begins to appear.
